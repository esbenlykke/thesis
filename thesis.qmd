## Outline of Introduction Section

-   The importance of sleep and physical activity tracking in health research.

Physical behaviors throughout a day encompass a range of activities, including sleep, physical activity (PA), and sedentary behavior. Numerous studies over the past decade have underscored the health benefits of optimal sleep, high PA levels, especially moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)[@kraus_physical_2019; @lee_effect_2012], minimal sedentary periods[@wilmot_sedentary_2012], and adequate sleep[@cappuccio_sleep_2010]. This robust evidence has informed public guidelines[@borodulin_physical_2023], such as the American recommendation of 150 minutes of MVPA per week[@kl_physical_2018], and the Danish guideline suggesting 30 minutes of MVPA daily for adults[@el-zine_fysisk_nodate-1] and 60 minutes for children[@el-zine_fysisk_nodate].

The integration of sleep and physical activity tracking in health research is paramount for a comprehensive understanding of individual well-being. Over the years, the significance of both sleep and physical activity in maintaining optimal health has been increasingly acknowledged[@kraus_physical_2019; @lee_effect_2012; @liguori_evolving_2023]. These elements are foundational to our well-being, influencing a spectrum of health aspects from mental health[@biddle_physical_2011] to physical fitness[@warburton_health_2017], and even disease prevention[@strath_guide_2013; @arem_leisure_2015].

With the advent of wearable technology and advanced tracking systems, researchers now possess tools that allow for an in-depth exploration of the intricate relationship between sleep, physical activity, and overall health[@rollo_whole_2020]. Traditional health assessments might have primarily focused on diet, weight, or blood pressure. However, by incorporating data on sleep and physical activity, we can achieve a more holistic understanding of health. For instance, sleep deprivation is associated with a range of health issues, from weight gain and decreased immune function to an increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease[@warburton_health_2017].

Building on this, the ability to monitor sleep and physical activity has revolutionized personalized health interventions. For example, if data reveals interrupted sleep patterns, interventions can be customized to address these specific issues. Similarly, if someone isn't achieving their physical activity targets, strategies can be formulated to boost their activity levels, potentially enhancing health outcomes[@rosenberger_24-hour_2019]. Furthermore, tracking these patterns provides researchers with insights into the mechanisms of various diseases and health conditions. Early detection of conditions like sleep apnea, characterized by intermittent breathing pauses during sleep, can lead to timely management, preventing a cascade of health complications[@cappuccio_sleep_2010]. For patients undergoing treatments, such as those with depression who often face sleep disturbances, tracking becomes vital. It allows healthcare providers to assess the effectiveness of interventions, whether they're antidepressant medications or other therapeutic strategies[@paruthi_consensus_2016].

In today's medical landscape, there's a pronounced focus on preventive healthcare. The principle is clear: it's better to prevent diseases than to treat them after they manifest. Regular tracking of sleep and physical activity can act as an early warning system, signaling potential health risks before they develop into severe conditions. For instance, consistent inactivity can heighten risks related to obesity, heart disease, and other chronic ailments[@tremblay_sedentary_2017]. Early detection through tracking can pave the way for timely interventions and preventive actions[@liguori_evolving_2023].

-   measurement of physical activity and sleep
-   subjective methods
-   objective methods

## Measurement of Physical Activity and Sleep

Physical activity and sleep are integral components of human behavior. Physical activity is characterized by multiple dimensions such as frequency, duration, intensity, and domains, making it challenging to measure all its aspects (21). Similarly, sleep is essential for health, and its accurate monitoring in terms of duration, quality, architecture, and circadian patterns is crucial. Various techniques are available to quantify both PA and sleep, broadly grouped into subjective and objective methods.

### Subjective Methods

Physical Activity Questionnaires and Diaries/Logs

In epidemiological studies, self-report methods, including PA questionnaires and diaries, have been primary tools due to their low cost, ease of use, and ability to capture the type and context of PA(25). Despite their advantages, these methods can be prone to biases, including reporting bias and misinterpretation, and may not always be reliable(25).

Sleep Questionnaires and Diaries

Subjective sleep quality can be assessed using tools like the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, reflecting one's satisfaction with sleep over a specified period, such as a month(78). While they are practical and cost-effective, self-report sleep assessments can overestimate sleep duration and may not capture all nuances of sleep quality(79). Sleep diaries, often regarded as the "gold standard" for subjective sleep assessment, provide daily insights but are dependent on memory and participant adherence(82).

### Objective Methods

Direct Observation and Polysomnography (PSG)

Direct observation allows researchers to record an individual's PA and sleep behaviors, capturing intricate details like frequency, duration, and intensity(21). PSG, on the other hand, is the gold standard for sleep measurement, monitoring various physiological aspects in a controlled setting(78). Both methods, while comprehensive, can be costly and labor-intensive.

Doubly Labelled Water Method

This method provides an estimate of total energy expenditure over several days and is a gold standard for PA(25). It's a powerful tool but comes with high costs and doesn't provide granular details on PA dimensions(26).

Physiological Recordings

Heart rate (HR) recordings can be used to estimate PA intensity, assuming a linear relationship between HR and PA intensity(27). While relatively cost-effective, various external factors can influence HR, making it less accurate for certain activities(27).

Device-based Methods: Pedometers, Accelerometers, and Actigraphy

Pedometers are simple devices that count steps and can provide additional metrics like distance traveled and calories burned(21). Accelerometers, such as GENEActiv and ActiGraph, offer detailed recordings of raw triaxial linear acceleration data, capturing a wide range of PA and sleep data(28). Wrist actigraphy, commonly used in sleep research, measures wrist movements to assess sleep or waking state(85). These devices are convenient and non-intrusive, but their data might vary due to different technical characteristics, making direct comparisons challenging(33).

### Sleep Assessment with Accelerometry

Wrist-worn accelerometers have become increasingly popular for PA assessment. They have been developed separately from clinical wrist actigraphy but offer the potential for dual PA and sleep data collection(90). New algorithms, like the GGIR-package in R, combine 24-hour activity data, but they often require a sleep log for accuracy(92). Some algorithms can detect sleep periods even without sleep diaries, but their validation remains limited(93).

-   Gold standards
-   Traditional methods and their limitations
-   polysomnography
-   self-reported diaries
-   The emergence and potential of wearable accelerometers and some kind segway to machine learning models in this field.

Some of these limitations can be addressed with 24-hour accelerometer-based protocols, especially those worn on the wrist[@rosenberger_24-hour_2019]. Wrist accelerometers are small, non-invasive, waterproof[@welk_reliability_2004], allowing for continuous, 24-hour wear with minimal disruption to the wearer, and permit uninterrupted activity measurement throughout the day, thereby tracking and analyzing daily changes in PA and sleep behaviors. Furthermore, the latest accelerometers supply raw acceleration data that can be processed using open-source analytical techniques to produce estimates of sleep, sedentary behavior, and PA[@migueles_comparability_2019]. Simultaneous measurement of physical behaviors, particularly feasible with wrist accelerometry, can offer a better comprehension of the influence of these behaviors on health indicators and their interrelationships. This data could be critical in shaping future health recommendations or interventions.

-   Supervised learning and annotation of data sources

Machine learning stands at the crossroads of statistics and computer science. It embodies the principles of discerning patterns and relationships from data, a foundational tenet of statistics, while also leveraging the power of efficient computing algorithms, a core concept in computer science[@hastie01statisticallearning]. With the surge in data scale, encompassing billions or even trillions of data points, this synergy becomes essential to navigate the intricate landscape of data analysis.

One of the primary branches of machine learning is supervised learning. Its primary objective is to predict known outputs based on inputs. Real-world applications of supervised learning span across various domains. For instance, in machine learning competitions, challenges often include tasks such as handwriting recognition, image classification (e.g., discerning between a cat and a dog), and document categorization (e.g., differentiating between a clinical trial on heart failure and a financial report). These tasks aim to emulate or even surpass human capabilities in specific areas. Supervised learning essentially revolves around two core concepts: classification (categorizing data into predefined groups) and prediction (estimating unknown parameters).

Delving deeper into its applications, consider the realm of physical activity and sleep research. Here, supervised learning plays a pivotal role. For instance, algorithms can automatically classify activity levels---from sedentary to vigorous---using data from accelerometers. Similarly, in sleep studies, such algorithms can discern between various sleep stages like light sleep or REM, using accelerometer or actigraphy data. While these machines emulate human analysts, their capabilities can extend beyond, unveiling insights or patterns not immediately visible to human researchers. A predictive model, for example, might forecast the risk of metabolic syndrome based on sedentary time patterns or predict sleep disorders from sleep pattern variations. (REFS PÅ HELE AFSNITTET)

The utilization of machine learning to decipher sleep and physical activity from accelerometry data is gaining traction. Its capability to model intricate non-linear relationships is unparalleled compared to traditional statistical methods like linear regression[@fiorillo_automated_2019]. Yet, the success of supervised learning hinges on abundant and accurately annotated data for ensuring both precision and applicability [@van_der_ploeg_modern_2014].

The significance of sleep, especially for children's health and development, is well-established [@chaput_systematic_2017; @chaput_systematic_2016; @st-onge_sleep_2016]. Healthy sleep encompasses several factors like duration, timing, and quality[@gruber_position_2014]. Yet, the potential of advanced machine learning in evaluating sleep using accelerometer data is still largely untapped[@haghayegh_application_2020].

Despite the supremacy of Polysomnography (PSG) as the gold standard for objective sleep analysis, its high costs, and intrusive nature underscore the value of accelerometry---a less invasive and more cost-effective alternative[@vaughn_technical_2008]. Recent endeavors in this domain include PSG-assessed sleep-wake classification using wrist-worn accelerometers. For example, Sundararajan et al.[@sundararajan_sleep_2021] leveraged a random forest machine learning algorithm, achieving commendable results. Yet, issues like high false discovery rates point to challenges such as limited subject variation.

To address these challenges, there's a clear imperative to diversify the sample base and extend recording durations. While accelerometry has its limitations, its feasibility for prolonged, out-of-lab recordings makes it invaluable [@van_de_water_objective_2011]. Given these dynamics, the focus should lean towards sleep timing algorithms rather than sleep staging.

A crucial aspect of deciphering sleep/wake cycles from accelerometry data is the annotation of time in bed, which, although not indicative of actual sleep duration, provides crucial insights. Such annotations can stem from individual sleep diaries, EEG-based recordings [@younes_staging_2016], or systems capturing tracheal sounds[@dafna_sleep-wake_2015; @montazeri_ghahjaverestan_sleepwakefulness_2020]. Given its practicality, accelerometry continues to be a staple in sleep research, echoing its immense potential and adaptability[@hees_novel_2015; @madsen_actigraphy_2013; @schwab_actigraphy_2018; @barouni_ambulatory_2020].

# Manual Annotation of Time in Bed Using Free-Living Recordings of Accelerometry Data

This segment of the thesis encompasses the methods, results, and discussion for Paper I. The study underscores the importance of effective machine learning algorithms for sleep/wake cycles, which ideally necessitate correct data annotations over a span of 7-10 days. Although sleep diaries or EEG recordings can annotate 'time in bed', many researches predominantly rely on accelerometry. This emphasizes the imperative for enhanced annotation techniques and their validity. Our objective is to introduce a manual annotation method, gauge its precision, and determine its consistency. Some of the details presented here were previously mentioned in the published version of Paper I[@skovgaard_manual_2021].

## Methods

### Study Population

The data for this study was sourced from the SCREENS pilot trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03788525), a two-arm parallel-group cluster-randomized trial with two intervention groups, conducted between October 2018 and March 2019[@rasmussen_feasibility_2021; @rasmussen_short-term_2020]. There was no control group in this trial.

Families from the Middelfart municipality in Denmark were approached for participation if they had a child aged between 6 to 10 years living with them, out of a total of 1686 families. To qualify, the parent's screen media usage had to exceed the median of 2.7 hours per day, based on survey responses from 394 respondents. Additionally, all children in the household needed to be older than 3.9 years to ensure that sleep measurements weren't disrupted by the nocturnal awakenings typical of infants or toddlers. For a comprehensive list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, refer to Pedersen et al.[@pedersen_self-administered_2021].

The study ultimately included data from 14 children and 19 adults. These participants weren't advised to alter their sleep or bedtime routines for the interventions. While the study focused on nightly sleep time as recorded by the EEG-based sleep staging system, any napping behavior of the participants was deemed irrelevant.

All data collection procedures were reported to the local data protection department, SDU RIO (ID: 10.391), in compliance with the Danish Data Protection Agency's regulations.

### Actigraphy

Both adults and children participated in 24-hour accelerometry recordings using two triaxial accelerometers, Axivity AX3 (Axivity Ltd., Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The Axivity AX3 is a compact device, measuring 23 mm × 32.5 mm × 7.6 mm and weighing just 11 g. It was set with a sensitivity of ±8 g and a sampling frequency of 50 Hz.

Participants wore the accelerometers at two specific anatomical locations. The first was positioned on the right hip, secured in a pocket attached to a belt around the waist, ensuring the USB connector faced outward from the body's right side. The second accelerometer was placed midway between the hip and knee on the right thigh, housed in a pocket on a belt, with the USB connector also facing away from the body.

For both the baseline and follow-up, the devices were worn for a duration of one week (seven consecutive days). This duration aligns with the recommended number of days to reliably gauge habitual physical activity[@jaeschke_variability_2018].

### Zmachine® Insight+ Sleep Assessments

Both adults and children were assessed for their sleep patterns using the Zmachine® (ZM) Insight+ model DT-200 (General Sleep Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA), Firmware version 5.1.0. This assessment was concurrent with the accelerometer recordings. At the baseline, the sleep assessment spanned 3--4 nights, while during the follow-up, it was conducted over 3 nights.

The ZM device operates by measuring sleep through a single-channel EEG, specifically from the differential mastoid (A1--A2) EEG location, evaluated on a 30-second epoch basis. Designed for use in everyday settings, the ZM provides an objective measurement of various sleep parameters, including sleep duration, sleep stage classification, and latency to different sleep stages.

The ZM's algorithm has been benchmarked against polysomnography (PSG) in laboratory settings for both adults with and without chronic sleep issues[@wang_evaluation_2015; @kaplan_performance_2014]. Our findings indicate that the ZM is effectively applicable to both children and adults for multi-day measurements in real-world settings[@hees_novel_2015]. Notably, the device showcased a high accuracy in distinguishing between sleep and wakefulness, with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values being 95.5%, 92.5%, 98%, and 84.2%, respectively[@kaplan_performance_2014].

For the assessment, three electrodes (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark, type: N-00-S/25) are positioned on the mastoids (for signal) and the nape (as ground). About half an hour before their intended sleep time, participants' skin areas are cleaned with alcohol swabs, after which the electrodes are affixed. An EEG cable connects these electrodes to the ZM device. A preliminary sensor check ensures all electrodes are correctly mounted; any issues are promptly addressed by replacing the problematic electrodes. Additionally, participants, or parents on behalf of their children, recorded their sleep and wake times daily in a dedicated diary.

### Audacity

Audacity®️ is a distinguished free audio editing software[@audacity]. The genesis of Audacity can be traced back to the fall of 1999, when it emerged as an innovative project led by Dominic Mazzoni and Roger Dannenberg at Carnegie Mellon University. By May 2000, it was unveiled to the world as an open-source audio editor. Since its inception, Audacity has undergone significant evolution. The software, developed collaboratively by the community, now boasts of hundreds of unique features, offers complete support for professional-grade 24-bit and 32-bit audio, has a comprehensive manual available in multiple languages, and has witnessed distribution in the millions. Today, a dedicated team of volunteers from various corners of the globe continues to maintain and enhance Audacity. It is disseminated under the GNU General Public License, granting everyone the freedom to utilize the software for personal, educational, or commercial endeavors.

In the realm of accelerometer data analysis, Audacity stands out. It furnishes researchers with the capability to meticulously scrutinize high-resolution raw accelerometer data with unparalleled precision. Users can quickly zoom in to delve deeper into specific segments of the recording, like certain patterns around bedtime, or zoom out for a broader perspective, such as data spanning a week. Furthermore, Audacity's sophisticated labeling function is pivotal for annotating the accelerometry data. Any generated labels can be preserved in an individual file and later integrated into machine learning algorithms. This level of detailed manual inspection of high-resolution accelerometer data offered by Audacity is, based on our knowledge, unparalleled by any other software.

Within the Audacity interface, there's the possibility of amalgamating over 100 channels of data. This aids in the merging of distinct signal features derived from acceleration. The integration of multiple signal features is intriguing as it might enhance the visual comprehension and classification of inherent behaviors. Nevertheless, an excessive conglomeration of signal features might obscure the precise identification of targeted behaviors. For our study, we incorporated a total of seven distinct signal features. The criteria for classifying "lying" in the first feature are explicit: if the inclination of the hip accelerometer surpasses 65 degrees and the thigh accelerometer simultaneously identifies as "sitting" based on Skotte et al.'s activity type classification algorithm[@skotte_detection_2014]. The other signal features, barring "time", are directly procured from Skotte et al.'s algorithm. These features, delineated in Table 1, concern the longitudinal axis of the body. Data derived from accelerometry undergoes processing using a window length of two seconds (60 samples) and has a 50% overlap (30 samples), ensuring a resolution of one second. The methodologies from Skotte et al. and those generating the first feature rely exclusively on the accelerometer's inclination(s). Hence, while they can determine time in bed and participant's posture, they aren't precise indicators for pinpointing exact in-bed and out-of-bed moments.

To provide a visual perspective, @fig-screen_full and @fig-screen_night depict the Audacity interface displaying all seven signal features as cataloged in @tbl-man_signal_features. @fig-screen_full offers a glimpse of a week's data, whereas @fig-screen_night zooms into an approximate 24-hour span, showcasing a single annotated night.

### Annotation Process Conducted by Expert Raters

Three experienced researchers, well-versed in working with accelerometer data, were chosen as raters. Their proficiency ensured that they had the requisite knowledge to accurately interpret the various data channels presented to them. Each rater meticulously reviewed and labeled each wav-file, marking specific timestamps that indicated in-bed and out-of-bed activities. These annotations were then saved as individual text files. For ensuring consistency and reliability in the annotations, each wav-file underwent two rounds of labeling. Importantly, at no point during this process were the raters privy to any prior annotations, either made by themselves or their colleagues.

### Establishing the Ground Truth Using ZM

The definitive ground truth for in-bed and out-of-bed time frames was gleaned from the sleep staging data derived from the ZM. This was established by identifying the first and last events at night that did not present any sensor-related issues. Nights where the ZM detected sensor problems, either at the onset or conclusion of the recording, were excluded from further consideration. Such sensor issues typically arise due to inadequate attachment of electrodes. To maintain accuracy in data collection, all participants were meticulously instructed to affix the ZM and activate it precisely at their bedtime and to detach it upon waking. These crucial timestamps were then utilized as the ground truth for the study.

### Statistical Analysis

The statistical interpretations for this study were achieved using the R statistical software (version 4.0.2, released on 22 June 2020) and its complementary interface, RStudio (version 1.1.456). For continuous variables, the descriptive attributes were gauged using medians and interquartile ranges. Meanwhile, categorical variables were assessed based on their proportions. To offer a clear distinction, the characteristics for children and adults were presented separately.

The core of the statistical analysis encompassed agreement studies which were executed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Bland--Altman analysis. Additionally, to provide a comprehensive visual representation of the agreement and symmetry across methodologies, probability density distribution plots were integrated. The ICC, as a metric, goes beyond merely correlating two techniques; it evaluates if they align in magnitude. The scale for interpretation is as follows:

$ICC < 0.5$ signifies poor agreement

$0.5 < ICC > 0.75$ indicates moderate agreement

$0.75 < ICC > 0.9$ represents good agreement

$ICC > 0.90$ underscores excellent agreemen

In this research, the ICC values were interpreted based on their 95% confidence intervals, adhering to recommended guidelines[@koo_guideline_2016]. The Bland--Altman analysis, on the other hand, is a tool to measure the concurrence between two measuring techniques[@bland_measuring_1999]. It calculates the average of the differences (representing bias) between the two methods, and also establishes the limits of this agreement. A positive mean difference suggests an earlier underestimation of the in-bed or out-of-bed timestamp relative to the ZM, while a negative difference indicates a later overestimation.

### Intraclass Correlation Coefficient Analyses

The analyses of Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) underscored an exemplary consistency when comparing ZM's automatic in-bed annotations with manual annotations. This was evident in both metrics assessed: time to bed and time out of bed. The high agreement was consistent across both evaluation phases---Round 1 and Round 2---and was observed in the initial baseline as well as the subsequent follow-up assessments. Reinforcing the robustness of these findings, the lower bounds of the confidence intervals consistently remained above 0.9, suggesting a high degree of reliability in the agreement. For a detailed breakdown of these results, please refer to @tbl-man_icc_zm_man.

In our analysis, we also identified a remarkable consistency between the data from self-reports and the ZM measurements. This high level of agreement was evident in both the initial baseline data as well as the subsequent follow-up data. The strength of this agreement is underscored by the fact that the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval never fell below a value of 0.94. For a detailed representation of this, please refer to @tbl-man_icc_zm_self.

Our analysis evaluated the agreement among three manual raters in annotating timestamps for both 'to bed' and 'out of bed' events. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) from this evaluation demonstrated strong consensus among the raters. Specifically, the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals were consistently strong, never dropping below 0.88, highlighting both good and excellent agreement levels. However, when analyzing the ICCs more closely, subtle variations appear between the 'to bed' and 'out of bed' timestamps. This nuanced observation is detailed in @tbl-man_icc_man_man.

The test-retest reliability exhibited good to excellent ICC agreement for each rater between the first and second rounds, applicable to both baseline and follow-up data (refer to @tbl-man_icc_test_retest). This robust reliability is further evidenced by the 95% confidence intervals having lower limits not less than 0.86. While the ICCs across raters are broadly consistent, there's a distinction: Raters 1 and 3 had slightly reduced agreement in their baseline to-bed annotations relative to subsequent ones. In contrast, Rater 2's ICC scores remained stable and didn't reflect this trend.

### Bland-Altman Analyses

@tbl-7 presents the bias and its corresponding confidence intervals, as well as the upper and lower limits of agreement, comparing manual annotation and self-report to ZM. The bias for manual annotation relative to ZM ranges from -6 minutes to 5 minutes. In contrast, the self-report exhibits a slightly smaller bias when compared to ZM. Notably, the magnitude of the limits of agreement appears consistent across both methods of comparison.
