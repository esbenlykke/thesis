	abstract = {Recent technological advances have transformed the research on physical activity initially based on questionnaire data to the most recent objective data from accelerometers. The shift to availability of raw accelerations has increased measurement accuracy, transparency, and the potential for data harmonization. However, it has also shifted the need for considerable processing expertise to the researcher. Many users do not have this expertise. The R package GGIR has been made available to all as a tool to convermulti-day high resolution raw accelerometer data from wearable movement sensors into meaningful evidence-based outcomes and insightful reports for the study of human daily physical activity and sleep. This paper aims to provide a one-stop overview of GGIR package, the papers underpinning the theory of GGIR, and how research contributes to the continued growth of the GGIR package. The package includes a range of literature-supported methods to clean the data and provide day-by-day, as well as full recording, weekly, weekend, and weekday estimates of physical activity and sleep parameters. In addition, the package also comes with a shell function that enables the user to process a set of input files and produce csv summary reports with a single function call, ideal for users less proficient in R. GGIR has been used in over 90 peer-reviewed scientific publications to date. The evolution of GGIR over time and widespread use across a range of research areas highlights the importance of open source software development for the research community and advancing methods in physical behavior research.},

	abstract = {As the costs of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) care and related clinical trials continue to rise, economically viable methods are being sought to effectively predict the relative utility of various treatment options. The high price of clinical trials has led to the development of alternative methods to collect and consolidate data. Comparative effectiveness research ({CER}) synthesizes existing evidence to address knowledge gaps and drive patient-focused clinical decisions and outcomes. {CER} methods compare the health outcomes and costs associated with interventions to determine the option with the maximum patient benefit at optimal cost. In addition to traditional {CER} approaches such as systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and retrospective claims analyses, Markov modeling and Bayesian analysis can be applied to predict patient outcomes in scenarios where clinical trials are not feasible. Additionally, cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analyses comprise "cost-effectiveness analyses." Cost-benefit analysis looks solely at monetary value, while cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses include gains in health and quality of life, providing a ratio of cost to benefit. This paper will discuss a range of approaches to {CER} including Markov modeling, mixed treatment comparisons, the Archimedes model, and Bayesian statistics, and provide guidance in interpreting data from these studies in a managed care context, with a particular focus on evaluating treatments for T2DM. It will also provide guidance on common indices of comorbidity used in health economics research. Data from these models can be used to reduce treatment costs and improve the overall quality of population-level health.},

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommended a minimum of 75 vigorous-intensity or 150 moderate-intensity minutes per week (7.5 metabolic-equivalent hours per week) of aerobic activity for substantial health benefit and suggested additional benefits by doing more than double this amount. However, the upper limit of longevity benefit or possible harm with more physical activity is unclear.
{OBJECTIVE}: To quantify the dose-response association between leisure time physical activity and mortality and define the upper limit of benefit or harm associated with increased levels of physical activity.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: We pooled data from 6 studies in the National Cancer Institute Cohort Consortium (baseline 1992-2003). Population-based prospective cohorts in the United States and Europe with self-reported physical activity were analyzed in 2014. A total of 661,137 men and women (median age, 62 years; range, 21-98 years) and 116,686 deaths were included. We used Cox proportional hazards regression with cohort stratification to generate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios ({HRs}) and 95\% {CIs}. Median follow-up time was 14.2 years.
{EXPOSURES}: Leisure time moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: The upper limit of mortality benefit from high levels of leisure time physical activity.
{RESULTS}: Compared with individuals reporting no leisure time physical activity, we observed a 20\% lower mortality risk among those performing less than the recommended minimum of 7.5 metabolic-equivalent hours per week ({HR}, 0.80 [95\% {CI}, 0.78-0.82]), a 31\% lower risk at 1 to 2 times the recommended minimum ({HR}, 0.69 [95\% {CI}, 0.67-0.70]), and a 37\% lower risk at 2 to 3 times the minimum ({HR}, 0.63 [95\% {CI}, 0.62-0.65]). An upper threshold for mortality benefit occurred at 3 to 5 times the physical activity recommendation ({HR}, 0.61 [95\% {CI}, 0.59-0.62]); however, compared with the recommended minimum, the additional benefit was modest (31\% vs 39\%). There was no evidence of harm at 10 or more times the recommended minimum ({HR}, 0.69 [95\% {CI}, 0.59-0.78]). A similar dose-response relationship was observed for mortality due to cardiovascular disease and to cancer.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: Meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans minimum by either moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities was associated with nearly the maximum longevity benefit. We observed a benefit threshold at approximately 3 to 5 times the recommended leisure time physical activity minimum and no excess risk at 10 or more times the minimum. In regard to mortality, health care professionals should encourage inactive adults to perform leisure time physical activity and do not need to discourage adults who already participate in high-activity levels.},

	abstract = {The deleterious health consequences of physical inactivity are vast, and they are of paramount clinical and research importance. Risk identification, benchmarks, efficacy, and evaluation of physical activity behavior change initiatives for clinicians and researchers all require a clear understanding of how to assess physical activity. In the present report, we have provided a clear rationale for the importance of assessing physical activity levels, and we have documented key concepts in understanding the different dimensions, domains, and terminology associated with physical activity measurement. The assessment methods presented allow for a greater understanding of the vast number of options available to clinicians and researchers when trying to assess physical activity levels in their patients or participants. The primary outcome desired is the main determining factor in the choice of physical activity assessment method. In combination with issues of feasibility/practicality, the availability of resources, and administration considerations, the desired outcome guides the choice of an appropriate assessment tool. The decision matrix, along with the accompanying tables, provides a mechanism for this selection that takes all of these factors into account. Clearly, the assessment method adopted and implemented will vary depending on circumstances, because there is no single best instrument appropriate for every situation. In summary, physical activity assessment should be considered a vital health measure that is tracked regularly over time. All other major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and smoking) are assessed routinely. Physical activity status should also be assessed regularly. Multiple physical activity assessment methods provide reasonably accurate outcome measures, with choices dependent on setting-specific resources and constraints. The present scientific statement provides a guide to allow professionals to make a goal-specific selection of a meaningful physical activity assessment method.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: The health benefits of physical activity and exercise are clear; virtually everyone can benefit from becoming more physically active. Most international guidelines recommend a goal of 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Many agencies have translated these recommendations to indicate that this volume of activity is the minimum required for health benefits. However, recent evidence has challenged this threshold-centered messaging as it may not be evidence-based and may create an unnecessary barrier to those who might benefit greatly from simply becoming more active. This systematic review evaluates recent systematic reviews that have examined the relationship between physical activity and health status.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses (based largely on epidemiological studies consisting of large cohorts) have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between physical activity and premature mortality and the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic medical conditions. The relationships between physical activity and health outcomes are generally curvilinear such that marked health benefits are observed with relatively minor volumes of physical activity.
{SUMMARY}: These findings challenge current threshold-based messaging related to physical activity and health. They emphasize that clinically relevant health benefits can be accrued by simply becoming more physically active. {VIDEO} {ABSTRACT}: http://links.lww.com/{HCO}/A42.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To synthesise reviews investigating physical activity and depression, anxiety, self-esteem and cognitive functioning in children and adolescents and to assess the association between sedentary behaviour and mental health by performing a brief review.
{METHODS}: Searches were performed in 2010. Inclusion criteria specified review articles reporting chronic physical activity and at least one mental health outcome that included depression, anxiety/stress, self-esteem and cognitive functioning in children or adolescents.
{RESULTS}: Four review articles reported evidence concerning depression, four for anxiety, three for self-esteem and seven for cognitive functioning. Nine primary studies assessed associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health. Physical activity has potentially beneficial effects for reduced depression, but the evidence base is limited. Intervention designs are low in quality, and many reviews include cross-sectional studies. Physical activity interventions have been shown to have a small beneficial effect for reduced anxiety, but the evidence base is limited. Physical activity can lead to improvements in self-esteem, at least in the short term. However, there is a paucity of good quality research. Reviews on physical activity and cognitive functioning have provided evidence that routine physical activity can be associated with improved cognitive performance and academic achievement, but these associations are usually small and inconsistent. Primary studies showed consistent negative associations between mental health and sedentary behaviour.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Association between physical activity and mental health in young people is evident, but research designs are often weak and effects are small to moderate. Evidence shows small but consistent associations between sedentary screen time and poorer mental health.},

Associations between sleep measures and various health parameters, including mortality at 24 months, were examined.Results: only 16\% of participants perceived their sleep as severely disturbed as assessed with questionnaire responses. Wrist accelerometry showed marked variation between normal and abnormal sleep–wake cycles that did not correlate with the participants' perception of sleep. Impaired sleep–wake cycles were significantly associated with cognitive impairment, disability, depression, increased falls, body mass index and arthritis but not with any other specific disease markers and with decreased survival.Conclusions: commonly used sleep questionnaires do not differentiate well between those with objectively determined disturbance of sleep–wake cycles and those with normal cycles. Abnormal sleep–wake patterns are associated with institutionalisation, cognitive impairment, disability, depression and arthritis but not with other diseases; there is also an association with reduced survival.},

Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. Methods We developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the {UK}, and the {USA}). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification \{wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep ({REM}), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep ({NREM})\} and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the {UK} Biobank with {\textasciitilde}100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. Findings After exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95\% limits of agreement ({LoA}): -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for {REM} duration (95\% {LoA}: -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95\% {LoA}: -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for {NREM} duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the {UK} Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 {UK} Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers ({\textless}6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios ({HRs}): 1.69; 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}): 1.28 to 2.24 ) or high sleep efficiency ({HRs}: 1.42; 95\% {CIs}: 1.14 to 1.77). Interpretation Deep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.},

	abstract = {Researchers are increasingly using 24 h accelerometer wear protocols. No automated method has been published that accurately distinguishes ‘waking’ wear time from other data (‘in-bed’, non-wear, invalid days) in young adults. This study examined the validity of an automated algorithm developed to achieve this for hip-worn Actigraph {GT}3X + 60 s epoch data. We compared the algorithm against a referent method (‘into-bed’ and ‘out-of-bed’ times visually identified by two independent raters) and benchmarked against two published algorithms. All methods used the same non-wear rules. The development sample (n = 11) and validation sample (n = 95) were Australian young adults from the Raine pregnancy cohort (54\% female), all aged approximately 22 years. The agreement with Rater 1 in each minute’s classification (yes/no) of waking wear time was examined as kappa (κ), limited to valid days (⩾10 h waking wear time per day) according to the algorithm and Rater 1. Bland–Altman methods assessed agreement in daily totals of waking wear and in-bed wear time. Excellent agreement (κ {\textgreater} 0.75) was obtained between the raters for 80\% of participants (median κ = 0.94). The algorithm showed excellent agreement with Rater 1 (κ {\textgreater} 0.75) for 89\% of participants and poor agreement (κ {\textless} 0.40) for 1\%. In this sample, the algorithm (median κ = 0.86) performed better than algorithms validated in children (median κ = 0.77) and adolescents (median κ = 0.66). The mean difference (95\% limits of agreement) between Rater 1 and the algorithm was 7 (−220, 234) min d−1 for waking wear time on valid days and −41 (−309, 228) min d−1 for in-bed wear time. In this population, the automated algorithm’s validity for identifying waking wear time was mostly good, not worse than inter-rater agreement, and better than the evaluated published alternatives. However, the algorithm requires improvement to better identify in-bed wear time.},

	abstract = {{STUDY} {OBJECTIVES}: We evaluated the interrater reliabilities of manual polysomnography sleep stage scoring. We included all studies that employed Rechtschaffen and Kales rules or American Academy of Sleep Medicine standards. We sought the overall degree of agreement and those for each stage.
{METHODS}: The keywords were "Polysomnography ({PSG})," "sleep staging," "Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K)," "American Academy of Sleep Medicine ({AASM})," "interrater (interscorer) reliability," and "Cohen's kappa." We searched {PubMed}, {OVID} Medline, {EMBASE}, the Cochrane library, {KoreaMed}, {KISS}, and the {MedRIC}. The exclusion criteria included automatic scoring and pediatric patients. We collected data on scorer histories, scoring rules, numbers of epochs scored, and the underlying diseases of the patients.
{RESULTS}: A total of 101 publications were retrieved; 11 satisfied the selection criteria. The Cohen's kappa for manual, overall sleep scoring was 0.76, indicating substantial agreement (95\% confidence interval, 0.71-0.81; P {\textless} .001). By sleep stage, the figures were 0.70, 0.24, 0.57, 0.57, and 0.69 for the W, N1, N2, N3, and R stages, respectively. The interrater reliabilities for stage N2 and N3 sleep were moderate, and that for stage N1 sleep was only fair.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We conducted a meta-analysis to generalize the variation in manual scoring of polysomnography and provide reference data for automatic sleep stage scoring systems. The reliability of manual scorers of polysomnography sleep stages was substantial. However, for certain stages, the results were poor; validity requires improvement.

	abstract = {Wearable physical activity sensors are widely used in research and practice as they provide objective measures of human behavior at a low cost. An important challenge for accurate assessment of physical activity behavior in free-living is the detection non-wear. Traditionally, heuristic algorithms that rely on specific interval lengths have been employed to detect non-wear time; however, machine learned models are emerging. We explore the potential of detecting non-wear using decision trees that combine raw acceleration and skin temperature, and we investigate the generalizability of our models, traditional heuristic algorithms, and recently developed machine learned models by external validation. The Decision tree models were trained using one week of data from thigh- and hip-worn accelerometers from 64 children. External validation was performed using data from wrist-worn accelerometers of 42 adolescents. For non-wear episodes longer than 60 min, the heuristic algorithms performed the best with F1-scores above 0.96. However, regarding episodes shorter than 60 min, the best performing method was the decision tree model including the six most important predictors with F1 scores above 0.74 for all sensor locations. We conclude that for classifying non-wear time, researchers should carefully select an appropriate method and we encourage the use of external validation when reporting on machine learned non-wear models.},

	abstract = {Background Actigraphy may provide a more valid assessment of sleep, circadian rhythm ({CR}), and physical activity ({PA}) than self-reported questionnaires, but has not been used widely to study the association with depression/anxiety and their clinical characteristics. Methods Fourteen-day actigraphy data of 359 participants with current (n = 93), remitted (n = 176), or no (n = 90) composite international diagnostic interview depression/anxiety diagnoses were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Objective estimates included sleep duration ({SD}), sleep efficiency, relative amplitude ({RA}) between day-time and night-time activity, mid sleep on free days ({MSF}), gross motor activity ({GMA}), and moderate-to-vigorous {PA} ({MVPA}). Self-reported measures included insomnia rating scale, {SD}, {MSF}, metabolic equivalent total, and {MVPA}. Results Compared to controls, individuals with current depression/anxiety had a significantly different objective, but not self-reported, {PA} and {CR}: lower {GMA} (23.83 vs. 27.4 milli-gravity/day, p = .022), lower {MVPA} (35.32 vs. 47.64 min/day, p = .023), lower {RA} (0.82 vs. 0.83, p = .033). In contrast, self-reported, but not objective, sleep differed between people with current depression/anxiety compared to those without current disorders; people with current depression/anxiety reported both shorter and longer {SD} and more insomnia. More depressive/anxiety symptoms and number of depressive/anxiety diagnoses were associated with larger disturbances of the actigraphy measures. Conclusion Actigraphy provides ecologically valid information on sleep, {CR}, and {PA} that enhances data from self-reported questionnaires. As those with more severe or comorbid forms showed the lowest {PA} and most {CR} disruptions, the potential for adjunctive behavioral and chronotherapy interventions should be explored, as well as the potential of actigraphy to monitor treatment response to such interventions.},

This review aims at summarising the results of studies published over the last decade regarding the use of actigraphy. Thirty-five studies proved eligible, and results were analysed separately for insomnia, narcolepsy and {RBD}. Actigraphy showed to consistently differentiate insomnia patients from healthy controls. Furthermore, the application of advanced analytical techniques has been shown to provide both unique insights into the physiology of insomnia and sleep misperception and to improve the specificity of actigraphy in detecting wakefulness within sleep periods. Regarding narcolepsy, several studies showed that actigraphy can detect peculiar sleep/wake disruption and the effects of pharmacological treatments. Finally, although the number of studies in {RBD} patients is still limited, the available evidence indicates a reduced amplitude of the activity pattern, sleep-wake rhythm dysregulation and daytime sleepiness. Therefore, the potential use of these markers as predictors of phenoconversion should be further explored. In conclusion, quantitative actigraphy presents a renewed interest when considering the possibility of using actigraphy in clinical sleep medicine to diagnose, monitor, and follow sleep disorders other than {CRSWD}.},

	abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from    imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of    ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or    ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    {ROC} space) than only under-sampling the majority class.  This paper    also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the    minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance (in {ROC} space) than varying the loss    ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of    over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples.  Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a    Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under    the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve ({AUC}) and the {ROC} convex    hull strategy.},

	abstract = {Common medical conditions are often associated with sleep abnormalities. Patients with medical disorders often suffer from poor sleep quality compared to healthy individuals, which in turn may worsen the symptoms of the disorder. Accurate detection of sleep/wake patterns is important in developing personalized digital markers, which can be used for objective measurements and efficient disease management. Big Data technologies and advanced analytics methods hold the promise to revolutionize clinical research processes, enabling the effective blending of digital data into clinical trials. Actigraphy, a non-invasive activity monitoring method is heavily used to detect and evaluate activities and movement disorders, and assess sleep/wake behavior. In order to study the connection between sleep/wake patterns and a cluster headache disorder, activity data was collected using a wearable device in the course of a clinical trial. This study presents two novel modeling schemes that utilize Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) to identify sleep/wake states. The proposed methods are a sequential {CNN}, reminiscent of the bi-directional {CNN} for slot filling, and a Multi-Task Learning ({MTL}) based model. Furthermore, we expand standard "Sleep" and "Wake" activity states space by adding the "Falling asleep" and "Siesta" states. We show that the proposed methods provide promising results in accurate detection of the expanded sleep/wake states. Finally, we explore the relations between the detected sleep/wake patterns and onset of cluster headache attacks, and present preliminary observations.},

	abstract = {This review re-examines the use of accelerometer and oxygen uptake data for the assessment of activity intensity. Accelerometers capture mechanical work, while oxygen uptake captures the energy cost of this work. Frequency filtering needs to be considered when processing acceleration data. A too restrictive filter attenuates the acceleration signal for walking and, to a higher degree, for running. This measurement error affects shorter (children) more than taller (adults) individuals due to their higher movement frequency. Less restrictive filtering includes more movement-related signals and provides measures that better capture mechanical work, but may include more noise. An optimal filter cut-point is determined where most relevant acceleration signals are included. Further, accelerometer placement affects what part of mechanical work being captured. While the waist placement captures total mechanical work and therefore contributes to measures of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature, the thigh and wrist placements capture more internal work and do not provide equivalent measures. Value calibration of accelerometer measures is usually performed using measured oxygen uptake with the metabolic equivalent of task ({MET}) as reference measure of activity intensity. However, the use of {MET} is not stringent and is not a measure of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature. A candidate measure is the mass-specific net oxygen uptake, {VO}2 net ({VO}2 tot - {VO}2 stand). To improve measurement of physical activity intensity using accelerometers, research developments are suggested concerning the processing of accelerometer data, use of energy expenditure as reference for activity intensity, and calibration procedure with absolute versus relative intensity.},

Despite significant knowledge concerning the importance of arousals for the sleep process in normal subjects and patients, comprehensive age norms have not been published. Methods: Seventy-six normal subjects (40 men) without sleep apnea or periodic limb movements of sleep, aged 18 to 70 years, slept in the sleep laboratory for 1 or more nights. Sleep and arousal data were scored by the same scorer for the first night (comparable to clinical polysomnograms) and summarized by age decade. Results: There were no statistically significant differences for sex or interaction of sex by age (p {\textgreater} .5 for both). The mean arousal index increased as a function of age. Newman-Keuls comparisons (.05) showed arousal index in the 18- to 20-year and 21- to 30-year age groups to be significantly less than the arousal index in the other 4 age groups. Arousal index in the 31-to 40-year and 41-to 50-year groups was significantly less than the arousal index in the older groups. The arousal index was significantly negatively correlated with total sleep time and all sleep stages (positive correlation with stage 1 and wake). Conclusions: Brief arousals are an integral component of the sleep process. They increase with other electroencephalographic markers as a function of age. They are highly correlated with traditional sleep-stage amounts and are related to major demographic variables. Age-related norms may make identification of pathologic arousal easier.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Existing normal polysomnography values are not truly normative as they are based on small sample sizes due to the fact that polysomnography is expensive and burdensome to obtain. There is a clear need for a large sample of truly normative data for clinical management and research. This study is a comprehensive meta-analysis of adult polysomnography parameters scored using recent criteria and establishes normative values adjusted for age and sex.
{METHODS}: For this meta-analysis of adult polysomnography parameters, we searched Scopus for studies of any design published between Jan 1, 2007, and July 31, 2016, that reported polysomnographic parameters scored using recent American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria (2007 or 2012) collected during an overnight level 1 in-laboratory sleep study in healthy controls. We excluded studies of patients with conditions or subjected to treatments that might affect sleep and studies not available in English. Study endpoints were the pooled estimates of 14 reported polysomnographic parameters. Estimates for each parameter were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. The influence of age and sex was ascertained using multivariate mixed-effects meta-regressions. This study is registered with {PROSPERO}, number {CRD}42017074319.
{FINDINGS}: Of 3712 articles, 169 studies, comprising 5273 participants, were eligible for inclusion. We report normative data stratified by age and sex. For each decade of age, total sleep time decreased by 10·1 min (95\% {CI} 7·5 to 12·8), sleep efficiency decreased by 2·1\% (1·5 to 2·6), wake after sleep onset increased by 9·7 min (6·9 to 12·4), sleep onset latency increased by 1·1 min (0·3 to 1·9), arousal index increased by 2·1 events per h (1·5 to 2·6), percentage of N1 sleep increased by 0·5\% (0·1 to 0·8), apnea-hypopnea index increased by 1·2 events per h (0·9 to 1·4), mean oxygen saturation decreased by 0·6\% (0·5 to 0·7), minimum oxygen saturation decreased by 1·8\% (1·3 to 2·3), and periodic limb movement index increased by 1·2 events per h (0·8 to 1·6). Changes with age in the percentage of N2 sleep (0·0\%, 95\% {CI} -0·1 to 0·1), N3 sleep (-0·1\%, -0·1 to 0·0), and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep (0·0\%, -0·1 to 0·0) were not significant. Every 10\% increase in the percentage of male participants was associated with reduced {REM} latency (0·9 min decrease, 95\% {CI} 0·1 to 1·6) and mean oxygen saturation (0·1\% decrease, 0·0 to 0·1), and greater arousal index (0·3 events per h, 0·0 to 0·5) and apnea-hypopnea index (0·2 events per h, 0·1 to 0·3).
{INTERPRETATION}: These normative values serve as a useful control reference for clinicians and for future research where it might be difficult to obtain polysomnographic controls. The resulting normative trends by age and sex might also be hypothesis-generating for a broad range of investigations.

{BACKGROUND}: Actigraphy is commonly used to assist sleep specialists in the diagnosis of various sleep and circadian-rhythm disorders. However, few validation studies incorporate large sample sizes, typical sleep clinic patients, or comparisons with subjective reports of sleep parameters.
{METHODS}: Clinical series with 100 consecutive sleep-disordered patients (69 men, 31 women, mean age of 49+/-14.7 years) at a tertiary sleep disorders center. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures were obtained from epoch-by-epoch comparison of {PSG} and actigraphic data. Subjective sleep parameter data were derived from questionnaires given to subjects in the morning following their recording night.
{RESULTS}: We found that total sleep time and sleep efficiency did not significantly differ between {PSG} data and the combined data obtained from actigraphy and subjective reports. Using a high-threshold (low-wake-sensitivity) actigraphic algorithm, the number of awakenings was not significantly different from those detected by {PSG}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We recommend the use of subjective data as an adjunct to actigraphic data in estimating total sleep time and sleep efficiency in sleep-disordered patients, especially those with disorders of excessive somnolence.},

Sixty-two Danish children aged 10.3 ± 0.6 years (mean ± standard deviation) wore an accelerometer (Actigraph {GT}3X+ Tri-Axis Accelerometer Monitor) on the right hip and on the non-dominant wrist for a continuous 7 days and 8 nights.

The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 98.8–99.7, 29.8–46.9 and 86.6–88.9\%, respectively. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were higher when assessed from the waist compared to the wrist measurement site (73.8 min, P {\textless} 0.001; 12.6\%, P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, the waist-worn and wrist-worn Actigraph monitors cannot be used interchangeably for the measurement of sleep indicators in children using the present algorithms.

	abstract = {Background
A need exists, from both a clinical and a research standpoint, for objective sleep measurement systems that are both easy to use and can accurately assess sleep and wake. This study evaluates the output of an automated sleep–wake detection algorithm (Z-{ALG}) used in the Zmachine (a portable, single-channel, electroencephalographic [{EEG}] acquisition and analysis system) against laboratory polysomnography ({PSG}) using a consensus of expert visual scorers.

Methods
Overnight laboratory {PSG} studies from 99 subjects (52 females/47 males, 18–60 years, median age 32.7 years), including both normal sleepers and those with a variety of sleep disorders, were assessed. {PSG} data obtained from the differential mastoids (A1–A2) were assessed by Z-{ALG}, which determines sleep versus wake every 30 seconds using low-frequency, intermediate-frequency, and high-frequency and time domain {EEG} features. {PSG} data were independently scored by two to four certified {PSG} technologists, using standard Rechtschaffen and Kales guidelines, and these score files were combined on an epoch-by-epoch basis, using a majority voting rule, to generate a single score file per subject to compare against the Z-{ALG} output. Both epoch-by-epoch and standard sleep indices (eg, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, latency to persistent sleep, and wake after sleep onset) were compared between the Z-{ALG} output and the technologist consensus score files.

Results
Overall, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting sleep using the Z-{ALG} as compared to the technologist consensus are 95.5\% and 92.5\%, respectively, across all subjects, and the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value for detecting sleep are 98.0\% and 84.2\%, respectively. Overall κ agreement is 0.85 (approaching the level of agreement observed among sleep technologists). These results persist when the sleep disorder subgroups are analyzed separately.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the Z-{ALG} automated sleep–wake detection algorithm, using the single A1–A2 {EEG} channel, has a level of accuracy that is similar to {PSG} technologists in the scoring of sleep and wake, thereby making it suitable for a variety of in-home monitoring applications, such as in conjunction with the Zmachine system.},

The advantages of actigraphy include high accuracy, simplicity of use and low intrusiveness. These features allow the use of actigraphy for determining sleep-wake states in such highly sensitive groups as infants. This study utilizes a motion sensor (accelerometer) for a dual purpose: to determine an infant's position in the crib and to identify sleep-wake states. The accelerometer was positioned over the sacral region on the infant's diaper, unlike commonly used attachment to an ankle. Opposed to broadly used discriminant analysis, this study utilized logistic regression and neural networks as predictors. The accuracy of predicted sleep-wake states was established in comparison to the sleep-wake states recorded by technicians in a polysomnograph study. Both statistical and neural predictors of this study provide an accuracy of approximately 77-92\% which is comparable to similar studies achieving prediction rates of 85-95\%, thus validating the suggested methodology. The results support the use of body motion as a simple and reliable method for determining sleep-wake states in infants. Nonlinear mapping capabilities of the neural network benefit the accuracy of sleep-wake state identification. Utilization of the accelerometer for the dual purpose allows us to minimize intrusiveness of home infant monitors.},

When the sleep-wake scoring algorithm derived from the nondominant hand was used to score the nondominant data for sleep-wake, overall agreement rates with polysomnography scoring ranged between 91 and 93\% for the calibration and validation samples. Results obtained with the same algorithm for the dominant-wrist data were within the same range. Agreement for sleep scoring was consistently higher than for wake scoring. Statistical manipulation of activity levels before applying the scoring algorithm indicated that this algorithm is quite robust toward moderate changes in activity level.

	abstract = {Wrist-worn accelerometers are increasingly being used for the assessment of physical activity in population studies, but little is known about their value for sleep assessment. We developed a novel method of assessing sleep duration using data from 4,094 Whitehall {II} Study (United Kingdom, 2012–2013) participants aged 60–83 who wore the accelerometer for 9 consecutive days, filled in a sleep log and reported sleep duration via questionnaire. Our sleep detection algorithm defined (nocturnal) sleep as a period of sustained inactivity, itself detected as the absence of change in arm angle greater than 5 degrees for 5 minutes or more, during a period recorded as sleep by the participant in their sleep log. The resulting estimate of sleep duration had a moderate (but similar to previous findings) agreement with questionnaire based measures for time in bed, defined as the difference between sleep onset and waking time (kappa = 0.32, 95\%{CI}:0.29,0.34) and total sleep duration (kappa = 0.39, 0.36,0.42). This estimate was lower for time in bed for women, depressed participants, those reporting more insomnia symptoms, and on weekend days. No such group differences were found for total sleep duration. Our algorithm was validated against data from a polysomnography study on 28 persons which found a longer time window and lower angle threshold to have better sensitivity to wakefulness, while the reverse was true for sensitivity to sleep. The novelty of our method is the use of a generic algorithm that will allow comparison between studies rather than a “count” based, device specific method.},

	abstract = {Wearable, multisensor, consumer devices that estimate sleep are now commonplace, but the algorithms used by these devices to score sleep are not open source, and the raw sensor data is rarely accessible for external use. As a result, these devices are limited in their usefulness for clinical and research applications, despite holding much promise. We used a mobile application of our own creation to collect raw acceleration data and heart rate from the Apple Watch worn by participants undergoing polysomnography, as well as during the ambulatory period preceding in lab testing. Using this data, we compared the contributions of multiple features (motion, local standard deviation in heart rate, and “clock proxy”) to performance across several classifiers. Best performance was achieved using neural nets, though the differences across classifiers were generally small. For sleep-wake classification, our method scored 90\% of epochs correctly, with 59.6\% of true wake epochs (specificity) and 93\% of true sleep epochs (sensitivity) scored correctly. Accuracy for differentiating wake, {NREM} sleep, and {REM} sleep was approximately 72\% when all features were used. We generalized our results by testing the models trained on Apple Watch data using data from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ({MESA}), and found that we were able to predict sleep with performance comparable to testing on our own dataset. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to analyze raw acceleration and heart rate data from a ubiquitous wearable device with accepted, disclosed mathematical methods to improve accuracy of sleep and sleep stage prediction.},

	abstract = {Background
We tested whether objectively measured indices of obstructive sleep apnea ({OSA}) and sleep quality are associated with coronary artery calcification ({CAC}) prevalence independent of obesity, a classic confounder.

Methods
A total of 1,465 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis participants [mean age 68 years], who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease, had both coronary {CT} and in-home polysomnography and actigraphy. {OSA} categories were defined by apnea-hypopnea index ({AHI}). Prevalence ratios for {CAC} {\textgreater}0 and {\textgreater}400 (high burden) were calculated.

Results
Participants with severe {OSA} ({AHI} ≥ 30; 14.6\%) were more likely to have prevalent {CAC}, relative to those with no evidence of {OSA}, after adjustment for demographics and smoking status [1.16 (95\% {CI}: 1.06–1.26)], body mass index [1.11 (1.02–1.21)], and traditional cardiovascular risk factors [1.10 (1.01–1.19)]. Other markers of hypoxemia tended to be associated with higher prevalence of {CAC} {\textgreater}0. For {CAC} {\textgreater}400 a higher prevalence was observed with both a higher arousal index and less slow-wave sleep. Overall, associations were somewhat stronger among younger participants, but did not vary by sex or race/ethnicity.

Conclusions
In this population-based multiethnic sample severe {OSA} was associated with subclinical coronary artery disease ({CAC} {\textgreater}0), independent of obesity and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, the associations of the arousal index and slow wave sleep with high {CAC} burden suggest that higher nightly sympathetic nervous system activation is also a risk factor. These findings highlight the potential importance in measuring disturbances in {OSA} as well as in sleep fragmentation as possible risk factors for coronary artery disease.},

However, the largest experiments conducted to date, have had only hundreds of participants. In this work, we processed the data of the recently published Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ({MESA}) Sleep study to have both {PSG} and actigraphy data synchronized. We propose the adoption of this publicly available large dataset, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than any other dataset, to systematically compare existing methods for the detection of sleep-wake stages, thus fostering the creation of new algorithms. We also implemented and compared state-of-the-art methods to score sleep-wake stages, which range from the widely used traditional algorithms to recent machine learning approaches. We identified among the traditional algorithms, two approaches that perform better than the algorithm implemented by the actigraphy device used in the {MESA} Sleep experiments. The performance, in regards to accuracy and F1 score of the machine learning algorithms, was also superior to the device’s native algorithm and comparable to human annotation. Future research in developing new sleep-wake scoring algorithms, in particular, machine learning approaches, will be highly facilitated by the cohort used here. We exemplify this potential by showing that two particular deep-learning architectures, {CNN} and {LSTM}, among the many recently created, can achieve accuracy scores significantly higher than other methods for the same tasks.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose an attention based convolutional neural network long short-term memory ({CNN}-{LSTM}) approach for sleep-wake detection with heterogeneous sensor data, i.e., acceleration and heart rate variability ({HRV}). Since the three-dimensional acceleration data was sampled with a high frequency, we firstly design a {CNN}-{LSTM} structure to effectively learn latent features from the acceleration. Meanwhile, considering the unique format of the {HRV} data, some effective features are extracted based on domain knowledge. Next, we design a unified architecture to efficiently merge the features learned by {CNN}-{LSTM} approach from the acceleration and the extracted features from the {HRV}, which enables us to make full use of all the available information from these two heterogeneous sources. Taking into consideration that these two heterogeneous sources may have distinct contributions for the sleep and wake states, we propose an attention network to dynamically adjust the importance of features from the two sources. Real-world experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach for sleep-wake detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all existing approaches for sleep-wake classification. In the evaluation of leave-one-subject-out ({LOSO}) cross-validation which is more challenging and practical, the proposed method achieves remarkable improvements ranging from 5\% to 46\% over the benchmark approaches.},

Previously developed ambulatory sleep detection methods rely either in whole or in part on self-reported diary data as ground truth, which is a problem, since people often do not fill them out accurately. This paper presents an algorithm that uses multimodal data from smartphones and wearable technologies to detect sleep/wake state and sleep onset/offset using a type of recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory ({LSTM}) cells for synthesizing temporal information. We collected 5580 days of multimodal data from 186 participants and compared the new method for sleep/wake classification and sleep onset/offset detection to, first, nontemporal machine learning methods and, second, a state-of-the-art actigraphy software. The new {LSTM} method achieved a sleep/wake classification accuracy of 96.5\%, and sleep onset/offset detection F1 scores of 0.86 and 0.84, respectively, with mean absolute errors of 5.0 and 5.5 min, res-pectively, when compared with sleep/wake state and sleep onset/offset assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries. The {LSTM} results were statistically superior to those from nontemporal machine learning algorithms and the actigraphy software. We show good generalization of the new algorithm by comparing participant-dependent and participant-independent models, and we show how to make the model nearly realtime with slightly reduced performance.},

Accuracy of sleep stage scoring was validated in 70 subjects assessed by six scorers. The best model performed better than any individual scorer (87\% versus consensus). It also reliably scores sleep down to 5 s instead of 30 s scoring epochs. A T1N marker based on unusual sleep stage overlaps achieved a specificity of 96\% and a sensitivity of 91\%, validated in independent datasets. Addition of {HLA}-{DQB}1*06:02 typing increased specificity to 99\%. Our method can reduce time spent in sleep clinics and automates T1N diagnosis.

	abstract = {The present study proposes a deep learning model, named {DeepSleepNet}, for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw single-channel {EEG}. Most of the existing methods rely on hand-engineered features which require prior knowledge of sleep analysis. Only a few of them encode the temporal information such as transition rules, which is important for identifying the next sleep stages, into the extracted features. In the proposed model, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks to extract time-invariant features, and bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory to learn transition rules among sleep stages automatically from {EEG} epochs. We implement a two-step training algorithm to train our model efficiently. We evaluated our model using different single-channel {EEGs} (F4-{EOG}(Left), Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) from two public sleep datasets, that have different properties (e.g., sampling rate) and scoring standards ({AASM} and R\&K). The results showed that our model achieved similar overall accuracy and macro F1-score ({MASS}: 86.2\%-81.7, Sleep-{EDF}: 82.0\%-76.9) compared to the state-of-the-art methods ({MASS}: 85.9\%-80.5, Sleep-{EDF}: 78.9\%-73.7) on both datasets. This demonstrated that, without changing the model architecture and the training algorithm, our model could automatically learn features for sleep stage scoring from different raw single-channel {EEGs} from different datasets without utilizing any hand-engineered features.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Although these modern devices offer many opportunities, e.g. communication and research online, an in-depth understanding of how these devices affect our health, is lacking. Before a definite randomized controlled trial, the {SCREENS} pilot study was conducted to assess compliance to and feasibility of two interventions, a measurement protocol, and a survey-based recruitment strategy. Also, the potential of the interventions to impact leisure time spent non-sedentary in children six-to-ten years of age was explored. Methods Families (N = 12) were recruited through a population-based survey sent out in October of 2018 to adults (N = 1,675) in the Municipality of Middelfart, Denmark. Families were randomized to one of two two-week interventions; an Evening Restriction intervention (no screen media use after six pm) and a General Restrict intervention (limit entertainment-based screen media to three hours/week/person). Intervention compliance was assessed objectively by measuring household {TV} usage, smartphone and tablet activity via an application, and via screen media diaries. During baseline and follow-up, as part of larger protocol, family members wore two triaxial accelerometers for seven consecutive days. The potential of the interventions to impact non-sedentary time was explored based on means and standard errors ({SEs}). Results Despite almost 85\% and 75\% reductions in leisure screen media use 0\% and 50\% of families were compliant in the Evening Restrict group and General Restrict group, respectively, based on strict a priori criteria. Participant feedback indicated that the General Restrict intervention generally was feasibly. Compliance to the accelerometry wear protocol was high (median non-wear was {\textless}1 hour/week). Moreover, the recruitment strategy was implemented and was feasible. The General restrict intervention might increase children’s non-sedentary time (mean ({SE}): 36.6 (23) min/day, N = 6).

The purpose of this systematic review is to compare the agreement between {ACT} and polysomnographic ({PSG}) measures of sleep in adults without chronic conditions and sleep complaints (healthy) and with chronic conditions.

	abstract = {As accelerometers are commonly used for 24-h measurements of daily activity, methods for separating waking from sleeping time are necessary for correct estimations of total daily activity levels accumulated during the waking period. Therefore, an algorithm to determine wake and bed times in 24-h accelerometry data was developed and the agreement of this algorithm with self-report was examined. One hundred seventy-seven participants (aged 40–75 years) of The Maastricht Study who completed a diary and who wore the {activPAL}3™ 24 h/day, on average 6 consecutive days were included. Intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}) was calculated and the Bland–Altman method was used to examine associations between the self-reported and algorithm-calculated waking hours. Mean self-reported waking hours was 15.8 h/day, which was significantly correlated with the algorithm-calculated waking hours (15.8 h/day, {ICC} = 0.79, P = {\textless} 0.001). The Bland–Altman plot indicated good agreement in waking hours as the mean difference was 0.02 h (95\% limits of agreement ({LoA}) = −1.1 to 1.2 h). The median of the absolute difference was 15.6 min (Q1–Q3 = 7.6–33.2 min), and 71\% of absolute differences was less than 30 min. The newly developed automated algorithm to determine wake and bed times was highly associated with self-reported times, and can therefore be used to identify waking time in 24-h accelerometry data in large-scale epidemiological studies.},

However, comparisons of methods for measuring sleep and time in bed using the thigh-worn accelerometer are rare. The authors compared the thigh-worn accelerometer algorithm that estimates time in bed with the output of a sleep diary (time in bed and time asleep). Methods: Participants (N = 5,498), from the 1970 British Cohort Study, wore an {activPAL} device on their thigh continuously for 7 days and completed a sleep diary. Bland–Altman plots and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between the algorithm derived and diary time in bed and asleep. Results: The algorithm estimated acceptable levels of agreement with time in bed when compared with diary time in bed (mean bias of −11.4 min; limits of agreement −264.6 to 241.8). The algorithm-derived time in bed overestimated diary sleep time (mean bias of 55.2 min; limits of agreement −204.5 to 314.8 min). Algorithm and sleep diary are reasonably correlated (ρ = .48, 95\% confidence interval [.45, .52] for women and ρ = .51, 95\% confidence interval [.47, .55] for men) and provide broadly comparable estimates of time in bed but not for sleep time. Conclusions: The algorithm showed acceptable estimates of time in bed compared with diary at the group level. However, about half of the participants were outside of the ±30 min difference of a clinically relevant limit at an individual level.},

	abstract = {The {activPAL} monitor, often worn 24 h d−1, provides accurate classification of sitting/reclining posture. Without validated automated methods, diaries—burdensome to participants and researchers—are commonly used to ensure measures of sedentary behaviour exclude sleep and monitor non-wear. We developed, for use with 24 h wear protocols in adults, an automated approach to classify activity bouts recorded in {activPAL} ‘Events’ files as ‘sleep’/non-wear (or not) and on a valid day (or not). The approach excludes long periods without posture change/movement, adjacent low-active periods, and days with minimal movement and wear based on a simple algorithm. The algorithm was developed in one population ({STAND} study; overweight/obese adults 18–40 years) then evaluated in {AusDiab} 2011/12 participants (n = 741, 44\% men, aged {\textgreater}35 years, mean ± {SD} 58.5 ± 10.4 years) who wore the {activPAL}3™ (7 d, 24 h d−1 protocol). Algorithm agreement with a monitor-corrected diary method (usual practice) was tested in terms of the classification of each second as waking wear (Kappa; κ) and the average daily waking wear time, on valid days. The algorithm showed ‘almost perfect’ agreement (κ {\textgreater} 0.8) for 88\% of participants, with a median kappa of 0.94. Agreement varied significantly (p {\textless} 0.05, two-tailed) by age (worsens with age) but not by gender. On average, estimated wear time was approximately 0.5 h d−1 higher than by the diary method, with 95\% limits of agreement of approximately this amount ±2 h d−1. In free-living data from Australian adults, a simple algorithm developed in a different population showed ‘almost perfect’ agreement with the diary method for most individuals (88\%). For several purposes (e.g. with wear standardisation), adopting a low burden, automated approach would be expected to have little impact on data quality. The accuracy for total waking wear time was less and algorithm thresholds may require adjustments for older populations.},

	abstract = {Background: The authors assessed agreement between participant diaries and two automated algorithms applied to {activPAL} ({PAL} Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, United Kingdom) data for classifying awake wear time in three age groups. Methods: Study 1 involved 20 youth and 23 adults who, by protocol, removed the {activPAL} occasionally to create nonwear periods. Study 2 involved 744 older adults who wore the {activPAL} continuously. Both studies involved multiple assessment days. In-bed, out-of-bed, and nonwear times were recorded in the participant diaries. The {CREA} (in {PAL} processing suite) and {ProcessingPAL} (secondary application) algorithms estimated out-of-bed wear time. Second- and day-level agreement between the algorithms and diary was investigated, as were associations of sedentary variables with self-rated health. Results: The overall accuracy for classifying out-of-bed wear time as compared with the diary was 89.7\% (Study 1) to 95\% (Study 2) for {CREA} and 89.4\% (Study 1) to 93\% (Study 2) for {ProcessingPAL}. Over 90\% of the nonwear time occurring in nonwear periods {\textgreater}165 min was detected by both algorithms, while {\textless}11\% occurring in periods ≤165 min was detected. For the daily variables, the mean absolute errors for each algorithm were generally within 0–15\% of the diary mean. Most Spearman correlations were very large (≥.81). The mean absolute errors and correlations were less favorable for days on which any nonwear time had occurred. The associations between sedentary variables and self-rated health were similar across processing methods. Conclusion: The automated awake wear-time classification algorithms performed similarly to the diary information on days without short (≤2.5–2.75 hr) nonwear periods. Because both diary and algorithm data can have inaccuracies, best practices likely involve integrating diary and algorithm output.},

	abstract = {A triaxial accelerometer worn on the thigh can provide information on the angle of rotation of the thigh. These data may be used to estimate periods of lying versus sitting.
          Purpose 
          To develop and test a classification algorithm to identify sedentary events as either lying or sitting events using a thigh-worn, triaxial accelerometer.
          Methods 
          Seven-day free-living activity from 14 sedentary workers was recorded using the {activPAL}3™ monitor. Participants recorded when they went to bed and when they got up in a diary. All “in-bed” sedentary events were assumed to be lying and all “not-in-bed” sedentary events as sitting. An algorithm computed the angle of rotation of the y-axis, which was used to detect orientation of the thigh. Crossing a rotational threshold in the transverse plane of ±65° was used to classify a sedentary event as lying. The classification accuracy of the algorithm was compared with self-reported classification from the diary.
          Results 
          The algorithm classified 96.7\% of the sedentary time “in bed” (sensitivity) as lying and 92.9\% of the time “not in bed” as not lying (specificity).
          Conclusions 
          Triaxial accelerometer data recorded from a single site on the thigh can be used to classify sedentary events as sitting and lying. The automated method developed in this study will allow objective measurement of diurnal lying time and that while sleeping without relying on self-report. This will help advance the understanding of the impact of different types of sedentary behaviors on various health outcomes.},

Aim: To refine and assess the validity of an algorithm to detect lying down from raw data of thigh-worn accelerometers. Axivity-{AX}3 accelerometers were placed on the thigh and upper back (reference) on adults in a development dataset (n = 50) and a validation dataset (n = 47) for 7 days. Sedentary time from the open Acti4-algorithm was used as input to the algorithm. In addition to the thigh-rotation criterion in the existing algorithm, two criteria based on standard deviation of acceleration and a time duration criterion of sedentary bouts were added. The mean difference (95\% agreement-limits) between the total identified lying time/day, between the refined algorithm and the reference was +2.9 (−135,141) min in the development dataset and +6.5 (−145,159) min in the validation dataset.

{METHODS}: Thirty-four adults (≥18 yr) wore the {activPAL}3, {GENEActiv}, and {ActiGraph} {GT}3X+ on the right thigh and an {ActiGraph} on the right hip while performing four lying, seven sitting, and five upright activities in the laboratory. Lying and sitting tasks incorporated a range of leg angles (e.g., lying with legs bent and sitting with legs crossed). Each activity was performed for 5 min while being directly observed. The percentage of the time the posture was correctly classified was calculated.
{RESULTS}: Participants consisted of 14 males and 20 females (mean age, 27.2 ± 5.9 yr; mean body mass index, 23.8 ± 3.7 kg·m). All postural allocation algorithms applied to monitors worn on the thigh correctly classified ≥93\% of the time lying, ≥91\% of the time sitting, and ≥93\% of the time upright. The {ActiGraph} waist proprietary algorithm correctly classified 72\% of the time lying, 58\% of the time sitting, and 74\% of the time upright. Both the {activPAL} and {ActiGraph} thigh proprietary algorithms misclassified sitting on a chair with legs stretched out (58\% and 5\% classified incorrectly, respectively). The {ActiGraph} thigh proprietary and open-source algorithm applied to the thigh-worn {ActiGraph} misclassified participants lying on their back with their legs bent 27\% and 9\% of the time, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: All postural allocation algorithms when applied to devices worn on the thigh were highly accurate in identifying lying, sitting, and upright postures. Given the poor accuracy of the waist algorithm for detecting sitting, caution should be taken if inferring sitting time from a waist-worn device.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The Prospective Physical Activity Sitting and Sleep consortium ({ProPASS}) is an international collaboration platform committed to harmonise thigh-worn accelerometry data. The aim of this paper is to (1) outline observational thigh-worn accelerometry studies and (2) summarise key strategic directions arising from the inaugural {ProPASS} meeting.
{METHODS}: (1) We performed a systematic scoping review for observational studies of thigh-worn triaxial accelerometers in free-living adults (n≥100, 24 hours monitoring protocols). (2)Attendees of the inaugural {ProPASS} meeting were sent a survey focused on areas related to developing {ProPASS}: important terminology (Q1); accelerometry constructs (Q2); advantages and distinct contribution of the consortium (Q3); data pooling and harmonisation (Q4); data access and sharing (Q5 and Q6).
{RESULTS}: (1) Eighty eligible articles were identified (22 primary studies; n{\textasciitilde}17 685). The accelerometers used most often were the {ActivPAL}3 and {ActiGraph} {GT}3X. The most commonly collected health outcomes were cardiometabolic and musculoskeletal. (2) None of the survey questions elicited the predefined 60\% agreement. Survey responses recommended that {ProPASS}: use the term physical behaviour or movement behaviour rather than 'physical activity' for the data we are collecting (Q1); make only minor changes to {ProPASS}'s accelerometry construct (Q2); prioritise developing standardised protocols/tools (Q4); facilitate flexible methods of data sharing and access (Q5 and Q6).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Thigh-worn accelerometry is an emerging method of capturing movement and posture across the 24 hours cycle. In 2020, the literature is limited to 22 primary studies from high-income western countries. This work identified {ProPASS}'s strategic directions-indicating areas where {ProPASS} can most benefit the field of research: use of clear terminology, refinement of the measured construct, standardised protocols/tools and flexible data sharing.},

	abstract = {Galileo Galilei’s quote ‘ measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so ’ has particular relevance to health behaviours, such as physical activity ({PA}), sitting and sleep, whose measurement during free living is notoriously difficult. To date, much of what we know about how these behaviours affect our health is based on self-report by questionnaires which have limited validity, are prone to bias and inquire about selective aspects of these behaviours. Although self-reported evidence has made great contributions to shaping public health and exercise medicine policy and guidelines until now,1 the ongoing advancements of accelerometry-based measurement and evidence synthesis methods are set to change the landscape. The aim of this editorial is to outline new directions in {PA} and sleep-related epidemiology that open new horizons for guideline development and improvement; and to describe a new research collaboration platform: the Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting, and Sleep consortium ({ProPASS}) (figure 1).



Figure 1 

Measurement technology used in epidemiology has made measurable what was not so until recently. Several population-based studies use accelerometers that are worn by participants for 24 hours a day for a whole week, offering unprecedented insights into the health attributes of {PA}, sitting and sleep. One of the most exciting aspects of accelerometers is that they show great promise for capturing nearly complete accounts of movement behaviour, including posture and activity type detection.2 

However, advanced measurement methods and optimal evidence synthesis are not synonymous. Individual …},

Methods: Seventeen subjects equipped with triaxial accelerometers ({ActiGraph} {GT}3X+) at the thigh and hip carried out a standardized test procedure including walking, running, cycling, walking stairs, sitting, and standing still. A method was developed (Acti4) to discriminate between these physical activity types based on threshold values of standard deviation of acceleration and the derived inclination. Moreover, the ability of the accelerometer placed at the thigh to detect sitting posture was separately validated during free living by comparison with recordings of pressure sensors in the hip pockets. Results: Sensitivity for discriminating between the physical activity types sitting, standing, walking, running, and cycling in the standardized trials were 99\%–100\% and 95\% for walking stairs. Specificity was higher than 99\% for all activities. During free living (140 hours of measurements), sensitivity and specificity for detection of sitting posture were 98\% and 93\%, respectively. Conclusion: The developed method for detecting physical activity types showed a high sensitivity and specificity for sitting, standing, walking, running, walking stairs, and cycling in a standardized setting and for sitting posture during free living.},

In this study, we defined sociodemographic and sleep characteristics associated with misreporting and assessed whether accounting for these factors better explains variation in objective sleep duration among 2,086 participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos who completed more than 5 nights of wrist actigraphy and reported habitual bed/wake times from 2010 to 2013. Using linear regression, we examined self-report as a predictor of actigraphy-assessed sleep duration. Mean amount of time spent asleep was 7.85 (standard deviation, 1.12) hours by self-report and 6.74 (standard deviation, 1.02) hours by actigraphy; correlation between them was 0.43. For each additional hour of self-reported sleep, actigraphy time spent asleep increased by 20 minutes (95\% confidence interval: 19, 22). Correlations between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed time spent asleep were lower with male sex, younger age, sleep efficiency \&lt;85\%, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration ≥1.5 hours. Adding sociodemographic and sleep factors to self-reports increased the proportion of variance explained in actigraphy-assessed sleep slightly (18\%–32\%). In this large validation study including Hispanics/Latinos, we demonstrated a moderate correlation between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed time spent asleep.

	abstract = {Objectives To describe new {WHO} 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour.
Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with {WHO} protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations.
Results The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150–300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold.
Conclusion These 2020 {WHO} guidelines update previous {WHO} recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the {WHO} Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.},

Current methods however are limited in their ability to take into account long-term sleep architectural patterns. A long short-term memory ({LSTM}) network is proposed as a solution to model long-term cardiac sleep architecture information and validated on a comprehensive data set (292 participants, 584 nights, 541.214 annotated 30 s sleep segments) comprising a wide range of ages and pathological profiles, annotated according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K) annotation standard. It is shown that the model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches which were often limited to non-temporal or short-term recurrent classifiers. The model achieves a Cohen’s k of 0.61 ± 0.15 and accuracy of 77.00 ± 8.90\% across the entire database. Further analysis revealed that the performance for individuals aged 50 years and older may decline. These results demonstrate the merit of deep temporal modelling using a diverse data set and advance the state-of-the-art for {HRV}-based sleep stage classification. Further research is warranted into individuals over the age of 50 as performance tends to worsen in this sub-population.},

The proper use of wearable technology in sleep research requires validated algorithms that can derive sleep outcomes from the sensor data. Since the publication of the first automated scoring algorithm by Webster in 1982, a variety of sleep algorithms have been developed and contributed to sleep research, including many recent ones that leverage machine learning and / or deep learning approaches. However, it remains unclear how these algorithms compare to each other on the same data set and if these modern data science approaches improve the analytical validity of sleep outcomes based on wrist-worn acceleration data. This work provides a systematic evaluation across 8 state-of-the-art sleep algorithms on a common sleep data set with polysomnography ({PSG}) as ground truth. Despite the inclusion of recently published complex algorithms, simple regression-based and heuristic algorithms demonstrated slightly superior performance in sleep-wake classification and sleep outcome estimation. The performance of complex machine learning and deep learning models seem to suffer from poor generalization. This independent and systematic analytical validation of sleep algorithms provides key evidence on the use of wearable digital health technologies for sleep research and care.},

However, the ability to estimate sleep duration or quality from thigh-worn accelerometers is uncertain and has not been evaluated in comparison with the ‘gold-standard’ measurement of sleep polysomnography. This study aimed to develop an algorithm for sleep estimation using the raw data from a thigh-worn accelerometer and to evaluate it in comparison with polysomnography. The algorithm was developed and optimised on a dataset consisting of 23 single-night polysomnography recordings, collected in a laboratory, from 15 asymptomatic adults. This optimised algorithm was then applied to a separate evaluation dataset, in which, 71 adult males (mean [{SD}] age 57 [11] years, height 181 [6] cm, weight 82 [13] kg) wore ambulatory polysomnography equipment and a thigh-worn accelerometer, simultaneously, whilst sleeping at home. Compared with polysomnography, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.55 when estimating sleep periods. Sleep intervals were underestimated by 21 min (130 min, Limits of Agreement Range [{LoAR}]). Total sleep time was underestimated by 32 min (233 min {LoAR}). Our results evaluate the performance of a new algorithm for estimating sleep and outline the limitations. Based on these results, we conclude that a single device can provide estimates of the sleep interval and total sleep time with sufficient accuracy for the measurement of daily physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep, on a group level in free-living settings.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Numerous studies have examined the validity of accelerometry-based activity monitors but few studies have systematically studied the reliability of different accelerometer units for assessing a standardized bout of physical activity. Improving understanding of error in these devices is an important research objective because they are increasingly being used in large surveillance studies and intervention trials that require the use of multiple units over time.
{METHODS}: Four samples of college-aged participants were recruited to collect reliability data on four different accelerometer types ({CSA}/{MTI}, Biotrainer Pro, Tritrac-R3D, and Actical). The participants completed three trials of treadmill walking (3 mph) while wearing multiple units of a specific monitor type. For each trial, the participant completed a series of 5-min bouts of walking (one for each monitoring unit) with 1-min of standing rest between each bout. Generalizability (G) theory was used to quantify variance components associated with individual monitor units, trials, and subjects as well as interactions between these terms.
{RESULTS}: The overall G coefficients range from 0.43 to 0.64 for the four monitor types. Corresponding intraclass correlation coefficients ({ICC}) ranged from 0.62 to 0.80. The {CSA}/{MTI} was found to have the least variability across monitor units and trials and the highest overall reliability. The Actical was found to have the poorest reliability.
{CONCLUSION}: The {CSA}/{MTI} appeared to have acceptable reliability for most research applications (G values above 0.60 and {ICC} values above 0.80), but values with the other devices indicate some possible concerns with reliability. Additional work is needed to better understand factors contributing to variability in accelerometry data and to determine appropriate calibration protocols to improve reliability of these measures for different research applications.},

{METHODS}: Data are from 10086 Women's Health Study participants (aged 71.6 years; {SD}, 5.7) who agreed to wear an accelerometer and complete a diary for 7 consecutive days. Generalized linear (multilevel) models with repeated measures were used to examine the adjusted associations of the following: (1) reported time in bed with next-day accelerometer-determined counts and time spent sedentary and in light- and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity {PA} ({MVPA}) and (2) accelerometer estimates with reported time in bed that night, expressed as short ({\textless}7 hours), optimal (7-9 hours), and long ({\textgreater}9 hours) sleep.
{RESULTS}: Across days, short sleep was associated with an average of 5500 ({SE}, 1352) higher accelerometer counts the following day but was also related to higher average sedentary (46.5 [{SE}, 1.5] minutes) and light-intensity {PA} (11.9 [{SE}, 1.2] minutes) than optimal sleep (all P{\textless}.001). Long sleep was associated with lower accelerometer counts, time spent sedentary and in light-intensity {PA}, and a reduced likelihood of engaging in ≥20 minutes of {MVPA} (all P{\textless}.001) than optimal sleep. Higher {PA} during the day (higher accelerometer counts and ≥20 minutes of accumulated {MVPA}) was associated with a reduced likelihood of reporting short or long sleep that night (all P{\textless}.001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Findings support the bidirectional associations of accelerometer-determined sedentary behavior and {PA} with reported time in bed in older women. Future studies are needed to confirm findings with sleep actigraphy in older women.},

Through an intensive longitudinal design, the present study aimed: (1) to elucidate the reciprocal associations between {PA} and sleep; and (2) to better understand the role of body mass index ({BMI}) in these 2 health behaviors.
{METHODS}: Community-dwelling midlife women (N = 103; M = 53, age range= 40-60 years) wore an accelerometer for the objective assessment of {PA} and sleep for 21 days. A series of multilevel models were estimated to test concurrent and lagged associations between {PA} (activity counts, moderate-to-vigorous {PA}) and sleep (total sleep time [{TST}], sleep efficiency, sleep fragmentation indices).
{RESULTS} {AND} {CONCLUSIONS}: In concurrent, same-day analyses, a positive association emerged between {PA} and sleep such that as activity counts increased during the day, {TST} at night also increased (P {\textless} .05). In lagged analyses examining next-day effect of sleep on {PA}, a negative association was found such that greater {TST} on a given night was associated with less moderate-to-vigorous {PA} the subsequent day (P {\textless} .05). A moderation effect by {BMI} was also observed such that women with a high {BMI} engaging in overall lower levels of {PA} demonstrated poorer-quality sleep. The data suggest that leading a physically active lifestyle may have protective effects on sleep, particularly for overweight and obese women.},

It is therefore vital to improve knowledge in fundamental physiology in order to understand the benefits of exercise on the quantity and quality of sleep in healthy subjects and patients. Conversely, sleep disturbances could also impair a person's cognitive performance or their capacity for exercise and increase the risk of exercise-induced injuries either during extreme and/or prolonged exercise or during team sports.

Thirty-four studies met these inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine studies concluded that exercise improved sleep quality or duration; however, four found no difference and one reported a negative impact of exercise on sleep. Study results varied most significantly due to participants' age, health status, and the mode and intensity of exercise intervention. Mixed findings were reported for children, adolescents, and young adults. Interventions conducted with middle-aged and elderly adults reported more robust results. In these cases, exercise promoted increased sleep efficiency and duration regardless of the mode and intensity of activity, especially in populations suffering from disease.

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the relative role of psychopathology in the relationship between physical activity and sleep, the present study investigated the day-to-day relationship between physical activity and sleep in individuals without a psychiatric disorder and individuals with bipolar disorder using a longitudinal, naturalistic design.

Method
Participants in two groups—a healthy group with no psychiatric illness (N=36) and an inter-episode bipolar disorder group (N=32)— were studied over a two-month period. Physical health was assessed by the {SF}-36. Daily subjective and objective measures of physical activity and sleep were collected. A total of 6,670 physical activity measurements and 6,548 sleep measurements were logged.

Results
The bipolar disorder group exhibited poorer physical health on the {SF}-36 and more sleep disturbance relative to the healthy group. No group differences were found in physical activity, nor in models examining the relationship between physical activity and sleep. Hierarchical linear models indicated that for every standard deviation increase in sleep disturbance (i.e., increased total wake time), there was a three percent decrease in subsequent day physical activity, in both the healthy and bipolar groups. Increased physical activity was associated with improved sleep for participants who reported greater average sleep disturbance.

Conclusions
The results for all participants in the study suggest that reduced physical activity and sleep difficulties may be mutually maintaining processes, particularly for individuals who suffer from poor sleep. Findings also raise the potential importance of targeting physical activity and sleep concurrently in interventions aimed at improving physical and mental health.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The objective of this study is to examine the temporal and bidirectional relationships between accelerometer-derived physical activity estimates and actigraphy-assessed sleep characteristics among older women.
{METHODS}: A subgroup of participants (N = 143, mean age = 73 yr) enrolled in the Healthy Women Study wore an {ActiGraph} accelerometer on their waist and an Actiwatch sleep monitor on their wrist concurrently for seven consecutive days. Multilevel models examined whether {ActiGraph}-assessed daily activity counts (ct·min⁻¹·d⁻¹) and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity ({MVPA}; min·d⁻¹) predicted Actiwatch-assessed sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation. Similar models were used to determine whether nighttime sleep characteristics predicted physical activity the following day.
{RESULTS}: In unadjusted models, greater daily activity counts (B = -0.05, P = 0.005) and more minutes of {MVPA} (B = -0.03, P = 0.01) were temporally associated with less total sleep time across the week. Greater sleep efficiency was associated with greater daily activity counts (B = 0.37, P = 0.01) and more minutes of {MVPA} (B = 0.64, P = 0.009) the following day. Less sleep fragmentation was also associated with greater daily activity counts and more {MVPA} the following day. Findings were similar after adjustment for age, education, body mass index, depressive symptoms, arthritis, and accelerometer wear time.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Few studies have used objective measures to examine the temporal relationships between physical activity and sleep. Notably, these findings suggest that nightly variations in sleep efficiency influence physical activity the following day. Thus, improving overall sleep quality in addition to reducing nightly fluctuations in sleep may be important for encouraging a physically active lifestyle in older women.},

After review of 864 published articles, the following sleep durations are recommended: Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Sleeping the number of recommended hours on a regular basis is associated with better health outcomes including: improved attention, behavior, learning, memory, emotional regulation, quality of life, and mental and physical health. Regularly sleeping fewer than the number of recommended hours is associated with attention, behavior, and learning problems. Insufficient sleep also increases the risk of accidents, injuries, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and depression. Insufficient sleep in teenagers is associated with increased risk of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts.

Current sleep-wake scoring algorithms for wrist-worn actigraphy suffer from low specificities, which leads to an underestimation of the time staying awake. The goal of this study ({ClinicalTrials}.gov Identifier: {NCT}03356938) was to develop a sleep-wake classifier with increased specificity. By artificially balancing the training dataset to contain as much wake as sleep epochs from day- and nighttime measurements from 12 subjects, we optimized the classification parameters to an optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. The resulting sleep-wake classifier achieved high specificity of 80.4\% and sensitivity of 88.6\% on the balanced dataset containing 3079.9 h of actimeter data. In the validation on night sleep of separate adaptation recordings from 19 healthy subjects, the sleep-wake classifier achieved 89.4\% sensitivity and 64.6\% specificity and estimated accurately total sleep time and sleep efficiency with a mean difference of 12.16 min and 2.83\%, respectively. This new, device-independent method allows to rid sleep-wake classifiers from their bias towards sleep detection and lay a foundation for more accurate assessments in everyday life, which could be applied to monitor patients with fragmented sleep-wake rhythms.},

As a result, the magnitude and moderators of these effects are unclear. This meta-analytical review examines the effects of acute and regular exercise on sleep, incorporating a range of outcome and moderator variables. {PubMed} and {PsycINFO} were used to identify 66 studies for inclusion in the analysis that were published through May 2013. Analyses reveal that acute exercise has small beneficial effects on total sleep time, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, stage 1 sleep, and slow wave sleep, a moderate beneficial effect on wake time after sleep onset, and a small effect on rapid eye movement sleep. Regular exercise has small beneficial effects on total sleep time and sleep efficiency, small-to-medium beneficial effects on sleep onset latency, and moderate beneficial effects on sleep quality. Effects were moderated by sex, age, baseline physical activity level of participants, as well as exercise type, time of day, duration, and adherence. Significant moderation was not found for exercise intensity, aerobic/anaerobic classification, or publication date. Results were discussed with regards to future avenues of research and clinical application to the treatment of insomnia.},

	abstract = {The physiologic mechanisms by which the four activities of sleep, sedentary behavior, light-intensity physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ({MVPA}) affect health are related, but these relationships have not been well explored in adults. Research studies have commonly evaluated how time spent in one activity affects health. Because one can only increase time in one activity by decreasing time in another, such studies cannot determine the extent that a health benefit is due to one activity versus due to reallocating time among the other activities. For example, interventions to improve sleep possibly also increase time spent in {MVPA}. If so, the overall effect of such interventions on risk of premature mortality is due to both more {MVPA} and better sleep. Further, the potential for interaction between activities to affect health outcomes is largely unexplored. For example, is there a threshold of {MVPA} minutes per day, above which adverse health effects of sedentary behavior are eliminated? This article considers the 24-h Activity Cycle (24-{HAC}) model as a paradigm for exploring inter-relatedness of health effects of the four activities. It discusses how to measure time spent in each of the four activities, as well as the analytical and statistical challenges in analyzing data based on the model, including the inevitable challenge of confounding among activities. The potential usefulness of this model is described by reviewing selected research findings that aided in the creation of the model and discussing future applications of the 24-{HAC} model.},

{OBJECTIVES}: To assess whether the population longitudinal evidence supports the presence of a relationship between duration of sleep and all-cause mortality, to investigate both short and long sleep duration and to obtain an estimate of the risk.
{METHODS}: We performed a systematic search of publications using {MEDLINE} (1966-2009), {EMBASE} (from 1980), the Cochrane Library, and manual searches without language restrictions. We included studies if they were prospective, had follow-up {\textgreater}3 years, had duration of sleep at baseline, and all-cause mortality prospectively. We extracted relative risks ({RR}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) and pooled them using a random effect model. We carried out sensitivity analyses and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias.
{RESULTS}: Overall, the 16 studies analyzed provided 27 independent cohort samples. They included 1,382,999 male and female participants (followup range 4 to 25 years), and 112,566 deaths. Sleep duration was assessed by questionnaire and outcome through death certification. In the pooled analysis, short duration of sleep was associated with a greater risk of death ({RR}: 1.12; 95\% {CI} 1.06 to 1.18; P {\textless} 0.01) with no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.74) but heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.02). Long duration of sleep was also associated with a greater risk of death (1.30; [1.22 to 1.38]; P {\textless} 0.0001) with no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.18) but significant heterogeneity between studies (P {\textless} 0.0001).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Strong evidence shows that physical inactivity increases the risk of many adverse health conditions, including major non-communicable diseases such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancers, and shortens life expectancy. Because much of the world's population is inactive, this link presents a major public health issue. We aimed to quantify the eff ect of physical inactivity on these major non-communicable diseases by estimating how much disease could be averted if inactive people were to become active and to estimate gain in life expectancy at the population level.
{METHODS}: For our analysis of burden of disease, we calculated population attributable fractions ({PAFs}) associated with physical inactivity using conservative assumptions for each of the major non-communicable diseases, by country, to estimate how much disease could be averted if physical inactivity were eliminated. We used life-table analysis to estimate gains in life expectancy of the population.
{FINDINGS}: Worldwide, we estimate that physical inactivity causes 6\% (ranging from 3·2\% in southeast Asia to 7·8\% in the eastern Mediterranean region) of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7\% (3·9-9·6) of type 2 diabetes, 10\% (5·6-14·1) of breast cancer, and 10\% (5·7-13·8) of colon cancer. Inactivity causes 9\% (range 5·1-12·5) of premature mortality, or more than 5·3 million of the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008. If inactivity were not eliminated, but decreased instead by 10\% or 25\%, more than 533 000 and more than 1·3 million deaths, respectively, could be averted every year. We estimated that elimination of physical inactivity would increase the life expectancy of the world's population by 0·68 (range 0·41-0·95) years.
{INTERPRETATION}: Physical inactivity has a major health eff ect worldwide. Decrease in or removal of this unhealthy behaviour could improve health substantially.

{METHODS}: Primary search encompassing 2006 to March, 2018 for existing systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and pooled analyses reporting on these relationships. Graded the strength of evidence using a matrix developed for the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee.
{RESULTS}: The association of self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ({MVPA}) on all-cause mortality, {CVD} mortality, and atherosclerotic {CVD}-including incident coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke and heart failure-are very similar. Increasing {MVPA} to guidelines amounts in the inactive {US} population has the potential to have an important and substantial positive impact on these outcomes in the adult population. The following points are clear: the associations of {PA} with beneficial health outcomes begin when adopting very modest (one-third of guidelines) amounts; any {MVPA} is better than none; meeting the 2008 {PA} guidelines reduces mortality and {CVD} risk to about 75\% of the maximal benefit obtained by physical activity alone; {PA} amounts beyond guidelines recommendations amount reduces risk even more, but greater amounts of {PA} are required to obtain smaller health benefits; and there is no evidence of excess risk over the maximal effect observed at about three to five times the amounts associated with current guidelines. When {PA} is quantified in terms of energy expenditure ({MET}·h·wk), these relationships hold for walking, running, and biking.
{CONCLUSIONS}: To avoid the risks associated with premature mortality and the development of ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and all-cause heart failure, all adults should strive to reach the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.},

	shorttitle = {The whole day matters},
	abstract = {Background
New research suggests that the composition (mix) of movement behaviors within a 24-h period may have important implications for health across the lifespan. Consistent with this integrated movement behavior paradigm, a number of countries across the world have developed and released 24-h movement guidelines for specific age groups. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the associations between the 24-h time-use composition of movement behaviors, or adherence to 24-h movement guidelines, and multiple health indicators across the lifespan.
Methods
Five online databases ({PsycINFO}, {PubMed}, {SPORTDiscus}, Web of Science, and Ovid {MEDLINE}) were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies published between January 2015 and January 2020 that met the a priori inclusion criteria, with no study design limits. The methodological quality of research evidence for each individual study and for each health indicator was assessed by using a modified version of the Downs and Black checklist.
Results
A total of 51 studies from 20 different countries met the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 studies examined adherence (meeting vs. not meeting) to 24-h movement guidelines, and 20 studies used compositional analyses to explore the 24-h time-use composition of movement behaviors. Findings indicated that meeting the 24-h movement guidelines were (1) not associated with adiposity among toddlers, (2) favorably associated with health-related quality of life, social-cognitive development, and behavioral and emotional problems among preschoolers, (3) favorably associated with global cognition, health-related quality of life, and healthy dietary patterns in children, and (4) favorably associated with adiposity, fitness, and cardiometabolic, mental, social, and emotional health among children and youth. Significant associations were also found between the composition of 24-h movement behaviors and indicators of (1) adiposity and bone and skeletal health among preschoolers, (2) health-related quality of life among children, (3) adiposity, fitness, and cardiometabolic, social, and emotional health among children and youth, (4) cardiometabolic health in adults, (5) adiposity and fitness among adults and older adults, and (6) mental health and risk of mortality among older adults. The quality of the available evidence ranged from poor to good.
Conclusion
The current evidence indicates that the composition of movement behaviors within a 24-h period may have important implications for health at all ages and that meeting the current 24-h movement guidelines is associated with a number of desirable health indicators in children and youth. Future studies should employ longitudinal and experimental designs, include valid and reliable measures of 24-h movement behaviors, and examine a wide array of health indicators across all age groups. Such studies would confirm the results from the primarily cross-sectional evidence drawn from studies included in our review and further advance our understanding of the relationships between 24-h movement behaviors and health.},

	abstract = {Background Physical activity has not been objectively measured in prospective cohorts with sufficiently large numbers to reliably detect associations with multiple health outcomes. Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the {UK} Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. Methods Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100Hz raw triaxial acceleration data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. Results 103,712 datasets were received (44.8\% response), with a median wear-time of 6.9 days ({IQR}:6.5–7.0). 96,600 participants (93.3\%) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7.5\% (2.35mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen’s d = 0.9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45-54yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0.66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0.12 for men, d = 0.09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0.27 for men, d = 0.15 for women) were small. Conclusions It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent in the afternoon and evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the {UK} Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses.},

We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing.

	abstract = {Purpose
The frequency of interruptions in sedentary time (sedentary breaks) is an aspect of sedentary behaviors which may be associated with metabolic health outcomes. The aim of this study was to describe the change in the frequency of sedentary breaks over a 10-year period from ages 5 to 15.

Methods
The longitudinal Iowa Bone Development Study has collected accelerometry data at approximately 5, 8, 11, 13, and 15 years of age. Data from participants who wore an accelerometer at least 10 hours per day and three days per data collection episode were used (423 children at age 5, 550 at age 8, 520 at age 11, 454 at age 13, and 344 at age 15). The frequency of sedentary breaks was determined based on accelerometry data and compared by weekday/weekend, time period during the day, gender, and data collection episode.

Results
The frequency of sedentary breaks decreased by {\textgreater} 200 times/day over a 10-year period from ages 5 to 15. Linear regression models estimated a 1.84 times/hour decrease per year for boys and a 2.04 times/hour decrease per year for girls (Ps {\textless} 0.0001). Both boys and girls showed significantly fewer breaks on weekdays from morning to 3:00 {PM} than on weekends from morning to 3:00 {PM} (Ps {\textless} 0.0001). The frequency of sedentary breaks was slightly higher among boys than girls (gender difference ≤ 2 times/hour; Ps {\textless} 0.01 at ages 11, 13, and 15).

Conclusion
Breaks in sedentary time notably decrease during childhood and adolescence. During school hours, boys and girls have fewer breaks in sedentary time than during any other time period of weekday or weekend day.},

In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to provide insight into the relationship between the algorithms’ hyperparameters and classification performance, as well as to generate tuned hyperparameter values to better detect episodes of wear and non-wear time. We used machine learning to construct a gold-standard dataset by combining two accelerometers and electrocardiogram recordings. The Hecht and Troiano algorithms achieved poor classification performance, while Choi exhibited moderate performance. Meanwhile, Hees outperformed all epoch-based algorithms. The sensitivity analysis and hyperparameter tuning revealed that all algorithms were able to achieve increased classification performance by employing larger intervals and windows, while more stringently defining artificial movement. These classification gains were associated with the ability to lower the false positives (type I error) and do not necessarily indicate a more accurate detection of the total non-wear time. Moreover, our results indicate that with tuned hyperparameters, epoch-based non-wear algorithms are able to perform just as well as raw-based non-wear algorithms with respect to their ability to correctly detect true wear and non-wear episodes.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: the use of movement monitors (accelerometers) for measuring physical activity ({PA}) in intervention and population-based studies is becoming a standard methodology for the objective measurement of sedentary and active behaviors and for the validation of subjective {PA} self-reports. A vital step in {PA} measurement is the classification of daily time into accelerometer wear and nonwear intervals using its recordings (counts) and an accelerometer-specific algorithm.
{PURPOSE}: the purpose of this study was to validate and improve a commonly used algorithm for classifying accelerometer wear and nonwear time intervals using objective movement data obtained in the whole-room indirect calorimeter.
{METHODS}: we conducted a validation study of a wear or nonwear automatic algorithm using data obtained from 49 adults and 76 youth wearing accelerometers during a strictly monitored 24-h stay in a room calorimeter. The accelerometer wear and nonwear time classified by the algorithm was compared with actual wearing time. Potential improvements to the algorithm were examined using the minimum classification error as an optimization target.
{RESULTS}: the recommended elements in the new algorithm are as follows: 1) zero-count threshold during a nonwear time interval, 2) 90-min time window for consecutive zero or nonzero counts, and 3) allowance of 2-min interval of nonzero counts with the upstream or downstream 30-min consecutive zero-count window for detection of artifactual movements. Compared with the true wearing status, improvements to the algorithm decreased nonwear time misclassification during the waking and the 24-h periods (all P values {\textless} 0.001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: the accelerometer wear or nonwear time algorithm improvements may lead to more accurate estimation of time spent in sedentary and active behaviors.},

	abstract = {To date, non-wear detection algorithms commonly employ a 30, 60, or even 90 mins interval or window in which acceleration values need to be below a threshold value. A major drawback of such intervals is that they need to be long enough to prevent false positives (type I errors), while short enough to prevent false negatives (type {II} errors), which limits detecting both short and longer episodes of non-wear time. In this paper, we propose a novel non-wear detection algorithm that eliminates the need for an interval. Rather than inspecting acceleration within intervals, we explore acceleration right before and right after an episode of non-wear time. We trained a deep convolutional neural network that was able to infer non-wear time by detecting when the accelerometer was removed and when it was placed back on again. We evaluate our algorithm against several baseline and existing non-wear algorithms, and our algorithm achieves a perfect precision, a recall of 0.9962, and an F1 score of 0.9981, outperforming all evaluated algorithms. Although our algorithm was developed using patterns learned from a hip-worn accelerometer, we propose algorithmic steps that can easily be applied to a wrist-worn accelerometer and a retrained classification model.},

Design A bi-moving-window-based approach was used to combine acceleration and skin temperature data to identify wear and non-wear time events in triaxial accelerometer data that monitor physical activity.
Setting Local residents in Swansea, Wales, {UK}.
Participants 50 participants aged under 16 years (n=23) and over 17 years (n=27) were recruited in two phases: phase 1: design of the wear/non-wear algorithm (n=20) and phase 2: validation of the algorithm (n=30).
Methods Participants wore a triaxial accelerometer ({GeneActiv}) against the skin surface on the wrist (adults) or ankle (children). Participants kept a diary to record the timings of wear and non-wear and were asked to ensure that events of wear/non-wear last for a minimum of 15 min.
Results The overall sensitivity of the proposed method was 0.94 (95\% {CI} 0.90 to 0.98) and specificity 0.91 (95\% {CI} 0.88 to 0.94). It performed equally well for children compared with adults, and females compared with males. Using surface skin temperature data in combination with acceleration data significantly improved the classification of wear/non-wear time when compared with methods that used acceleration data only (p{\textless}0.01).
Conclusions Using either accelerometer seismic information or temperature information alone is prone to considerable error. Combining both sources of data can give accurate estimates of non-wear periods thus giving better classification of sedentary behaviour. This method can be used in population studies of physical activity in free-living environments.},

This study explores compliance with a novel dual-accelerometer system for capturing 24 h movement patterns in two free-living samples of children and adults. A total of 103 children aged 8 years and 83 adults aged 20-60 years were recruited. Using a combination of medical dressing and purpose-built foam pouches, participants were fitted with two Axivity {AX}3 accelerometers\&mdash;one to the thigh and the other to the lower back\&mdash;for seven 24 h periods. {AX}3 accelerometers contain an inbuilt skin temperature sensor that facilitates wear time estimation. The median ({IQR}) wear time in children was 160 (67) h and 165 (79) h (out of a maximum of 168 h) for back and thigh placement, respectively. Wear time was significantly higher and less variable in adults, with a median ({IQR}) for back and thigh placement of 168 (1) and 168 (0) h. A greater proportion of adults (71.6\%) achieved the maximum number of complete days when compared to children (41.7\%). We conclude that a dual-accelerometer protocol using skin attachment methods holds considerable promise for monitoring 24-h movement behaviours in both children and adults.},

	abstract = {Introduction Human body acceleration is often used as an indicator of daily physical activity in epidemiological research. Raw acceleration signals contain three basic components: movement, gravity, and noise. Separation of these becomes increasingly difficult during rotational movements. We aimed to evaluate five different methods (metrics) of processing acceleration signals on their ability to remove the gravitational component of acceleration during standardised mechanical movements and the implications for human daily physical activity assessment. Methods An industrial robot rotated accelerometers in the vertical plane. Radius, frequency, and angular range of motion were systematically varied. Three metrics (Euclidian norm minus one [{ENMO}], Euclidian norm of the high-pass filtered signals [{HFEN}], and {HFEN} plus Euclidean norm of low-pass filtered signals minus 1 g [{HFEN}+]) were derived for each experimental condition and compared against the reference acceleration (forward kinematics) of the robot arm. We then compared metrics derived from human acceleration signals from the wrist and hip in 97 adults (22–65 yr), and wrist in 63 women (20–35 yr) in whom daily activity-related energy expenditure ({PAEE}) was available. Results In the robot experiment, {HFEN}+ had lowest error during (vertical plane) rotations at an oscillating frequency higher than the filter cut-off frequency while for lower frequencies {ENMO} performed better. In the human experiments, metrics {HFEN} and {ENMO} on hip were most discrepant (within- and between-individual explained variance of 0.90 and 0.46, respectively). {ENMO}, {HFEN} and {HFEN}+ explained 34\%, 30\% and 36\% of the variance in daily {PAEE}, respectively, compared to 26\% for a metric which did not attempt to remove the gravitational component (metric {EN}). Conclusion In conclusion, none of the metrics as evaluated systematically outperformed all other metrics across a wide range of standardised kinematic conditions. However, choice of metric explains different degrees of variance in daily human physical activity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Few studies have compared the validity of objective measures of physical activity energy expenditure ({PAEE}) in pregnant and non-pregnant women. {PAEE} is commonly estimated with accelerometers attached to the hip or waist, but little is known about the validity and participant acceptability of wrist attachment. The objectives of the current study were to assess the validity of a simple summary measure derived from a wrist-worn accelerometer ({GENEA}, Unilever Discover, {UK}) to estimate {PAEE} in pregnant and non-pregnant women, and to evaluate participant acceptability.
{METHODS}: Non-pregnant (N = 73) and pregnant (N = 35) Swedish women (aged 20-35 yrs) wore the accelerometer on their wrist for 10 days during which total energy expenditure ({TEE}) was assessed using doubly-labelled water. {PAEE} was calculated as 0.9×{TEE}-{REE}. British participants (N = 99; aged 22-65 yrs) wore accelerometers on their non-dominant wrist and hip for seven days and were asked to score the acceptability of monitor placement (scored 1 [least] through 10 [most] acceptable).
{RESULTS}: There was no significant correlation between body weight and {PAEE}. In non-pregnant women, acceleration explained 24\% of the variation in {PAEE}, which decreased to 19\% in leave-one-out cross-validation. In pregnant women, acceleration explained 11\% of the variation in {PAEE}, which was not significant in leave-one-out cross-validation. Median ({IQR}) acceptability of wrist and hip placement was 9(8-10) and 9(7-10), respectively; there was a within-individual difference of 0.47 (p{\textless}.001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: A simple summary measure derived from a wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer adds significantly to the prediction of energy expenditure in non-pregnant women and is scored acceptable by participants.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To describe physical activity levels of children (6-11 yr), adolescents (12-19 yr), and adults (20+ yr), using objective data obtained with accelerometers from a representative sample of the U.S. population.
{METHODS}: These results were obtained from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey ({NHANES}), a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population in the United States. Data are described from 6329 participants who provided at least 1 d of accelerometer data and from 4867 participants who provided four or more days of accelerometer data.
{RESULTS}: Males are more physically active than females. Physical activity declines dramatically across age groups between childhood and adolescence and continues to decline with age. For example, 42\% of children ages 6-11 yr obtain the recommended 60 min x d(-1) of physical activity, whereas only 8\% of adolescents achieve this goal. Among adults, adherence to the recommendation to obtain 30 min x d(-1) of physical activity is less than 5\%.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Objective and subjective measures of physical activity give qualitatively similar results regarding gender and age patterns of activity. However, adherence to physical activity recommendations according to accelerometer-measured activity is substantially lower than according to self-report. Great care must be taken when interpreting self-reported physical activity in clinical practice, public health program design and evaluation, and epidemiological research.},

Physical activity was measured by accelerometry and was expressed as average intensity (counts/minute) and amount of time (minutes/day) spent engaging in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity ({MVPA}). Time spent in sedentary behaviors was also objectively measured. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by means of the 20-m shuttle run test. Level of maternal education was reported by the adolescents. A higher proportion of boys (56.8\% of boys vs. 27.5\% of girls) met the physical activity recommendations of at least 60 minutes/day of {MVPA}. Adolescents spent most of the registered time in sedentary behaviors (9 hours/day, or 71\% of the registered time). Both average intensity and {MVPA} were higher in adolescents with high cardiorespiratory fitness, and sedentary time was lower in the high-fitness group. There were no physical activity or sedentary time differences between maternal education categories. These data provide an objective measure of physical activity and amount of time spent in sedentary behaviors in a relatively large number of European adolescents.},

Twenty-two {COPD} patients utilizing long-term oxygen recruited from 5 sites of the {COPD} Clinical Research Network wore a triaxial accelerometer ({RT}3, Stayhealthy, Monrovia, {CA}) during waking hours over a 14-day period. Computerized algorithms were composed allowing minute-by-minute activity data to be analyzed to determine, for each minute, whether the monitor was being worn. Temporal alignment allowed determination of average time course of activity level, expressed as average vector magnitude units ({VMU}, the vectorial sum of activity counts in three orthogonal directions) per minute, for each hour of the day. Mid-day activity was quantified as average {VMU}/minute between 10AM and 4PM for minutes the monitor was worn. Over the 14 day monitoring period, subjects wore the monitor an average of 11.4 +/- 3.0 hours x day(-1). During mid-day hours, subjects wore the monitor 76.3\% of the time and generated an average activity level of 112 +/- 55 {VMU} x min(-1). Increase in precision of activity estimates with longer monitoring periods was demonstrated. This analysis scheme allows a detailed temporal pattern of activity to be defined from triaxial accelerometer recordings and has the potential to facilitate comparisons among subjects and between subject groups.

{OBJECTIVE}: To provide recommendations to improve the accuracy of physical activity derived from self report.
{PROCESS}: We provide an overview of presentations and a compilation of perspectives shared by the authors of this paper and workgroup members.
{FINDINGS}: We identified a conceptual framework for reducing errors using physical activity self-report questionnaires. The framework identifies 6 steps to reduce error: 1) identifying the need to measure physical activity, 2) selecting an instrument, 3) collecting data, 4) analyzing data, 5) developing a summary score, and 6) interpreting data. Underlying the first 4 steps are behavioral parameters of type, intensity, frequency, and duration of physical activities performed, activity domains, and the location where activities are performed. We identified ways to reduce measurement error at each step and made recommendations for practitioners, researchers, and organizational units to reduce error in questionnaire assessment of physical activity.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Self-report measures of physical activity have a prominent role in research and practice settings. Measurement error may be reduced by applying the framework discussed in this paper.},

Such data provide a series of activity counts at every minute or even more often and displays a person's activity pattern throughout a day. Unfortunately, the collected data can include irregular missing intervals because of noncompliance of participants and therefore make the statistical analysis more challenging. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel imputation method to handle the multivariate count data, motivated by the accelerometer data structure. We specify the predictive distribution of the missing data with a mixture of zero-inflated Poisson and Log-normal distribution, which is shown to be effective to deal with the minute-by-minute autocorrelation as well as under- and over-dispersion of count data. The imputation is performed at the minute level and follows the principles of multiple imputation using a fully conditional specification with the chained algorithm. To facilitate the practical use of this method, we provide an R package accelmissing. Our method is demonstrated using 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data.},

This study aimed to assess the comparability of acceleration metrics between commonly-used body-attachment locations for 24 hours, waking and sleeping hours, and to test comparability of {PA} cut points between dominant and non-dominant wrist. Forty-five young adults (23 women, 18–41 years) were included and {GT}3X + accelerometers ({ActiGraph}, Pensacola, {FL}, {USA}) were placed on their right hip, dominant, and non-dominant wrist for 7 days. We derived Euclidean Norm Minus One g ({ENMO}), Low-pass filtered {ENMO} ({LFENMO}), Mean Amplitude Deviation ({MAD}) and {ActiGraph} activity counts over 5-second epochs from the raw accelerations. Metric values were compared using a correlation analysis, and by plotting the differences by time of the day. Cut points for the dominant wrist were derived using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient optimization in a grid of possible thresholds, using the non-dominant wrist estimates as reference. They were cross-validated in a separate sample (N = 36, 10 women, 22–30 years). Shared variances between pairs of acceleration metrics varied across sites and metric pairs (range in r2: 0.19–0.97, all p {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that some sites and metrics are associated, and others are not. We observed higher metric values in dominant vs. non-dominant wrist, thus, we developed cut points for dominant wrist based on {ENMO} to classify sedentary time ({\textless}50 mg), light {PA} (50–110 mg), moderate {PA} (110–440 mg) and vigorous {PA} (≥440 mg). Our findings suggest differences between dominant and non-dominant wrist, and we proposed new cut points to attenuate these differences. {ENMO} and {LFENMO} were the most similar metrics, and they showed good comparability with {MAD}. However, counts were not comparable with {ENMO}, {LFENMO} and {MAD}.},

{PURPOSE}: The purpose of this study was to compare raw and count data between hip-worn {ActiGraph} {GT}3X+ and {GT}9X Link accelerometers.
{METHODS}: Adults (n = 26 (n = 15 women); age, 49.1 ± 20.0 yr) wore {GT}3X+ and Link accelerometers over the right hip for an 80-min protocol involving 12-21 sedentary, household, and ambulatory/exercise activities lasting 2-15 min each. For each accelerometer, mean and variance of the raw (60 Hz) data for each axis and vector magnitude ({VM}) were extracted in 30-s epochs. A machine learning model (Montoye 2015) was used to predict energy expenditure in {METs} from the raw data. Raw data were also processed into activity counts in 30-s epochs for each axis and {VM}, with Freedson 1998 and 2011 count-based regression models used to predict {METs}. Time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous intensities was derived from predicted {METs} from each model. Correlations were calculated to compare raw and count data between accelerometers, and percent agreement was used to compare epoch-by-epoch activity intensity.
{RESULTS}: For raw data, correlations for mean acceleration were 0.96 ± 0.05, 0.89 ± 0.16, 0.71 ± 0.33, and 0.80 ± 0.28, and those for variance were 0.98 ± 0.02, 0.98 ± 0.03, 0.91 ± 0.06, and 1.00 ± 0.00 in the X, Y, and Z axes and {VM}, respectively. For count data, corresponding correlations were 1.00 ± 0.01, 0.98 ± 0.02, 0.96 ± 0.04, and 1.00 ± 0.00, respectively. Freedson 1998 and 2011 count-based models had significantly higher percent agreement for activity intensity (95.1\% ± 5.6\% and 95.5\% ± 4.0\%) compared with the Montoye 2015 raw data model (61.5\% ± 27.6\%; P {\textless} 0.001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Count data were more highly comparable than raw data between accelerometers. Data filtering and/or more robust raw data models are needed to improve raw data comparability between {ActiGraph} {GT}3X+ and Link accelerometers.},

{METHODS}: Five cross-sectional studies were included from England, Portugal, Norway and Sweden. {ActiGraph} accelerometer count data were centrally processed using the same algorithms. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to study the associations of sedentary time and physical inactivity with sex, age, weight status and educational level, in both the pooled sample and the separate study samples.
{RESULTS}: Data from 9509 participants were used. On average, participants were sedentary for 530 min/day, and accumulated 36 min/day of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. Twenty-three percent accumulated more than 10 h of sedentary time/day, and 72\% did not meet the physical activity recommendations. Nine percent of all participants were classified as high sedentary and low active. Participants from Norway showed the highest levels of sedentary time, while participants from England were the least physically active. Age and weight status were positively associated with sedentary time and not meeting the physical activity recommendations. Men and higher-educated people were more likely to be highly sedentary, while women and lower-educated people were more likely to be inactive.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We found high levels of sedentary time and physical inactivity in four European countries. Older people and obese people were most likely to display these behaviours and thus deserve special attention in interventions and policy planning. In order to monitor these behaviours, accelerometer-based cross-European surveillance is recommended.},

	abstract = {Sleep disturbance influences human health. To examine sleep patterns, it is advisable to utilize valid subjective and objective measures. Laboratory-based polysomnography ({PSG}) is deemed the gold standard to measure sleep objectively, but is impractical for long-term and home utilization (e.g. resource-demanding, difficult to use). Hence, alternative devices have been developed. This study aimed to review the literature systematically, providing an overview of available objective sleep measures in non-laboratory settings as an alternative to {PSG}. To identify relevant articles, a specific search strategy was run in {EMBASE}, {PubMed}, {CINAHL}, {PsycInfo} and Compendex (Engineering Village 2). In addition, reference lists of retrieved articles were screened and experts within this research field were contacted. Two researchers, using specified in/exclusion criteria, screened identified citations independently in three stages: on title, abstract and full text. Data from included articles were extracted and inserted into summarizing tables outlining the results. Of the 2217 electronically identified citations, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. Additional searches revealed eight papers. Psychometric characteristics of nine different objective measures of sleep pattern alternatives to {PSG} [(bed) actigraphy, observation, bed sensors, eyelid movement- and non-invasive arm sensors, a sleep switch and a remote device] were evaluated. Actigraphy is used widely and has been validated in several populations. Alternative devices to measure sleep patterns are becoming available, but most remain at prototype stage and are validated insufficiently. Future research should concentrate on the development and further validation of non-invasive, inexpensive and user-friendly sleep measures for non-laboratory settings.},

	abstract = {This is a systematic review of the scientific literature with regard to normal sleep patterns in infants and children (0-12 years). The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ({PRISMA}) guidelines. Mean and variability data for sleep duration, number of night wakings, sleep latency, longest sleep period overnight, and number of daytime naps were extracted from questionnaire or diary data from 34 eligible studies. Meta-analysis was conducted within age-bands and categories. In addition, fractional polynomial regression models were used to estimate best-fit equations for the sleep variables in relation to age. Reference values (means) and ranges (±1.96 {SD}) for sleep duration (hours) were: infant, 12.8 (9.7-15.9); toddler/preschool, 11.9 (9.9-13.8); and child, 9.2 (7.6-10.8). The best-fit (R(2)=0.89) equation for hours over the 0-12 year age range was 10.49-5.56×[(age/10){\textasciicircum}0.5-0.71]. Meta-regression showed predominantly Asian countries had significantly shorter sleep (1h less over the 0-12 year range) compared to studies from Caucasian/non-Asian countries. Night waking data provided 4 age-bands up to 2 years ranging from 0 to 3.4 wakes per night for infants (0-2 months), to 0-2.5 per night (1-2 year-olds). Sleep latency data were sparse but estimated to be stable across 0-6 years. Because the main data analysis combined data from different countries and cultures, the reference values should be considered as global norms.},

	abstract = {Background
We previously published the performance evaluation of an automated electroencephalography ({EEG})-based single-channel sleep–wake detection algorithm called Z-{ALG} used by the Zmachine® sleep monitoring system. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of a new algorithm called Z-{PLUS}, which further differentiates sleep as detected by Z-{ALG} into Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, and Rapid Eye Movement ({REM}) Sleep, against laboratory polysomnography ({PSG}) using a consensus of expert visual scorers.

Methods
Single night, in-lab {PSG} recordings from 99 subjects (52F/47M, 18–60 years, median age 32.7 years), including both normal sleepers and those reporting a variety of sleep complaints consistent with chronic insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome, as well as those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant medications, previously evaluated using Z-{ALG} were re-examined using Z-{PLUS}. {EEG} data collected from electrodes placed at the differential-mastoids (A1–A2) were processed by Z-{ALG} to determine wake and sleep, then those epochs detected as sleep were further processed by Z-{PLUS} to differentiate into Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, and {REM}. {EEG} data were visually scored by multiple certified polysomnographic technologists according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales criterion, and then combined using a majority-voting rule to create a {PSG} Consensus score file for each of the 99 subjects. Z-{PLUS} output was compared to the {PSG} Consensus score files for both epoch-by-epoch (eg, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa) and sleep stage-related statistics (eg, Latency to Deep Sleep, Latency to {REM}, Total Deep Sleep, and Total {REM}).

Results
Sensitivities of Z-{PLUS} compared to the {PSG} Consensus were 0.84 for Light Sleep, 0.74 for Deep Sleep, and 0.72 for {REM}. Similarly, positive predictive values were 0.85 for Light Sleep, 0.78 for Deep Sleep, and 0.73 for {REM}. Overall, kappa agreement of 0.72 is indicative of substantial agreement.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates that Z-{PLUS} can automatically assess sleep stage using a single A1–A2 {EEG} channel when compared to the sleep stage scoring by a consensus of polysomnographic technologists. Our findings suggest that Z-{PLUS} may be used in conjunction with Z-{ALG} for single-channel {EEG}-based sleep staging.},

To this end, wearable accelerometers are widely used as they are both low in price and provide reasonably accurate estimates of movement. Techniques to classify sleep from the high-resolution accelerometer data primarily rely on heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we explore the potential of detecting sleep using Random forests. Models were trained using data from three different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64 good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93\% on a previously unseen test set of 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful using machine learning (\$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{F1-score\} {\textgreater} 93.31{\textbackslash}\%\$\$), and when combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour (\$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{r\}=.60\$\$). These Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only accelerometer data.},

{METHODS}: In all, 54 individuals participated in the study. Sleep was assessed for 7 consecutive nights using actigraphy as an objective measure, and the Karolinska sleep diary for a subjective measure of quality. Using intra-class correlation and the Spearman-Brown formula, calculations of how many nights of measurements were required for a reliable measure were performed. Differences in reliability according to whether or not weekend measurements were included were investigated. Further, the correlation between objectively (actigraphy) measured sleep and subjectively measured sleep quality was studied over the different days of the week.
{RESULTS}/{CONCLUSIONS}: The results concerning actigraphy sleep measures suggest that data from at least 2 nights are to be recommended when assessing sleep percent and at least 5 nights when assessing sleep efficiency. For actigraphy-measured total sleep time, more than 7 nights are needed. At least 6 nights of measurements are required for a reliable measure of self-reported sleep. Fewer nights (days) are required if measurements include only week nights. Overall, there was a low correlation between the investigated actigraphy sleep parameters and subjective sleep quality, suggesting that the two methods of measurement capture different dimensions of sleep.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of {ICC} in the content of reliability analysis.
{DISCUSSION} {FOR} {RESEARCHERS}: There are 10 forms of {ICCs}. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the {ICC} form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of {ICC} to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting {ICC} should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections.
{DISCUSSION} {FOR} {READERS}: When coming across an article that includes {ICC}, readers should first check whether information about the {ICC} form has been reported and if an appropriate {ICC} form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the {ICC} estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of {ICC} and suggests the best practice of reporting {ICC} parameters in scientific publications.

	issn = {1179-1608},
	doi = {10.2147/NSS.S276107},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The current gold standard to detect sleep/wakefulness is based on electroencephalogram, which is inconvenient if included in portable sleep screening devices. Therefore, a challenge in the portable devices is sleeping time estimation. Without sleeping time, sleep parameters such as apnea/hypopnea index ({AHI}), an index for quantifying sleep apnea severity, can be underestimated. Recent studies have used tracheal sounds and movements for sleep screening and calculating {AHI} without considering sleeping time. In this study, we investigated the detection of sleep/wakefulness states and estimation of sleep parameters using tracheal sounds and movements.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Participants with suspected sleep apnea who were referred for sleep screening were included in this study. Simultaneously with polysomnography, tracheal sounds and movements were recorded with a small wearable device, called the Patch, attached over the trachea. Each 30-second epoch of tracheal data was scored as sleep or wakefulness using an automatic classification algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was compared to the sleep/wakefulness scored blindly based on the polysomnography.
{RESULTS}: Eighty-eight subjects were included in this study. The accuracy of sleep/wakefulness detection was 82.3±8.66\% with a sensitivity of 87.8±10.8 \% (sleep), specificity of 71.4±18.5\% (awake), F1 of 88.1±9.3\% and Cohen's kappa of 0.54. The correlations between the estimated and polysomnography-based measures for total sleep time and sleep efficiency were 0.78 (p{\textless}0.001) and 0.70 (p{\textless}0.001), respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: Sleep/wakefulness periods can be detected using tracheal sound and movements. The results of this study combined with our previous studies on screening sleep apnea with tracheal sounds provide strong evidence that respiratory sounds analysis can be used to develop robust, convenient and cost-effective portable devices for sleep apnea monitoring.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives To develop and validate a novel non-contact system for whole-night sleep evaluation using breathing sounds analysis ({BSA}). Design Whole-night breathing sounds (using ambient microphone) and polysomnography ({PSG}) were simultaneously collected at a sleep laboratory (mean recording time 7.1 hours). A set of acoustic features quantifying breathing pattern were developed to distinguish between sleep and wake epochs (30 sec segments). Epochs (n = 59,108 design study and n = 68,560 validation study) were classified using {AdaBoost} classifier and validated epoch-by-epoch for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa. Sleep quality parameters were calculated based on the sleep/wake classifications and compared with {PSG} for validity. Setting University affiliated sleep-wake disorder center and biomedical signal processing laboratory. Patients One hundred and fifty patients (age 54.0±14.8 years, {BMI} 31.6±5.5 kg/m2, m/f 97/53) referred for {PSG} were prospectively and consecutively recruited. The system was trained (design study) on 80 subjects; validation study was blindly performed on the additional 70 subjects. Measurements and Results Epoch-by-epoch accuracy rate for the validation study was 83.3\% with sensitivity of 92.2\% (sleep as sleep), specificity of 56.6\% (awake as awake), and Cohen's kappa of 0.508. Comparing sleep quality parameters of {BSA} and {PSG} demonstrate average error of sleep latency, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency of 16.6 min, 35.8 min, and 29.6 min, and 8\%, respectively. Conclusions This study provides evidence that sleep-wake activity and sleep quality parameters can be reliably estimated solely using breathing sound analysis.

	abstract = {{STUDY} {OBJECTIVES}: To determine the reasons for inter-scorer variability in sleep staging of polysomnograms ({PSGs}).
{METHODS}: Fifty-six {PSGs} were scored (5-stage sleep scoring) by 2 experienced technologists, (first manual, M1). Months later, the technologists edited their own scoring (second manual, M2) based upon feedback from the investigators that highlighted differences between their scoring. The {PSGs} were then scored with an automatic system (Auto) and the technologists edited them, epoch-by-epoch (Edited-Auto). This resulted in 6 different manual scores for each {PSG}. Epochs were classified as scorer errors (one M1 score differed from the other 5 scores), scorer bias (all 3 scores of each technologist were similar, but differed from the other technologist) and equivocal (sleep scoring was inconsistent within and between technologists).
{RESULTS}: Percent agreement after M1 was 78.9\% ± 9.0\% and was unchanged after M2 (78.1\% ± 9.7\%) despite numerous edits (≈40/{PSG}) by the scorers. Agreement in Edited-Auto was higher (86.5\% ± 6.4\%, p {\textless} 1E-9). Scorer errors ({\textless} 2\% of epochs) and scorer bias (3.5\% ± 2.3\% of epochs) together accounted for {\textless} 20\% of M1 disagreements. A large number of epochs (92 ± 44/{PSG}) with scoring agreement in M1 were subsequently changed in M2 and/or Edited-Auto. Equivocal epochs, which showed scoring inconsistency, accounted for 28\% ± 12\% of all epochs, and up to 76\% of all epochs in individual patients. Disagreements were largely between awake/{NREM}, N1/N2, and N2/N3 sleep.
{CONCLUSION}: Inter-scorer variability is largely due to epochs that are difficult to classify. Availability of digitally identified events (e.g., spindles) or calculated variables (e.g., depth of sleep, delta wave duration) during scoring may greatly reduce scoring variability.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Differentiating nonwear time from sleep and wake times is essential for the estimation of sleep duration based on actigraphy data. To efficiently analyze large-scale data sets, an automatic method of identifying these three different states is required. Therefore, we developed a classification algorithm to determine nonwear, sleep and wake periods from accelerometer data. Our work aimed to (I) develop a new pattern recognition algorithm for identifying nonwear periods from actigraphy data based on the influence of respiration rate on the power spectrum of the acceleration signal and implement it in an automatic classification algorithm for nonwear/sleep/wake states; ({II}) address motion artifacts that occur during nonwear periods and are known to cause misclassification of these periods; ({III}) adjust the algorithm depending on the sensor position (wrist, chest); and ({IV}) validate the algorithm on both healthy individuals and patients with sleep disorders.
{METHODS}: The study involved 98 participants who wore wrist and chest acceleration sensors for one day of measurements. They spent one night in the sleep laboratory and continued to wear the sensors outside of the laboratory for the remainder of the day. The results of the classification algorithm were compared to those of the reference source: polysomnography for wake/sleep and manual annotations for nonwear/wear classification.
{RESULTS}: The median kappa values for the two locations were 0.83 (wrist) and 0.84 (chest). The level of agreement did not vary significantly by sleep health (good sleepers vs. subjects with sleep disorders) (p = 0.348, p = 0.118) or by sex (p = 0.442, p = 0.456). The intraclass correlation coefficients of nonwear total time between the reference and the algorithm were 0.92 and 0.97 with the outliers and 0.95 and 0.98 after the outliers were removed for the wrist and chest, respectively. There was no evidence of an association between the mean difference (and 95\% limits of agreement) and the mean of the two methods for either sensor position (wrist p = 0.110, chest p = 0.164), and the mean differences (algorithm minus reference) were 5.11 [95\% {LoA} -15.4-25.7] and 1.32 [95\% {LoA} -9.59-12.24] min/day, respectively, after the outliers were removed.
{DISCUSSION}: We studied the influence of the respiration wave on the power spectrum of the acceleration signal for the differentiation of nonwear periods from sleep and wake periods. The algorithm combined both spectral analysis of the acceleration signal and rescoring. Based on the Bland-Altman analysis, the chest-worn accelerometer showed better results than the wrist-worn accelerometer.},

	doi = {10.1513/AnnalsATS.201801-004OC},
	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Poor sleep quality is common in the intensive care unit ({ICU}) and may be associated with adverse outcomes. Hence, {ICU}-based efforts to promote sleep are gaining attention, motivating interest in methods to measure sleep in critically ill patients. Actigraphy evaluates rest and activity by algorithmically processing gross motor activity data, usually collected by a noninvasive wristwatch-like accelerometer device. In critically ill patients, actigraphy has been used as a surrogate measure of sleep; however, its use has not been systematically reviewed.
{OBJECTIVES}: To conduct a systematic review of {ICU}-based studies that used actigraphy as a surrogate measure of sleep, including its feasibility, validity, and reliability as a measure of sleep in critically ill patients.
{METHODS}: We searched {PubMed}, {EMBASE}, {CINAHL}, Proquest, and Web of Science for studies that used actigraphy to evaluate sleep in five or more patients in an {ICU} setting.
{RESULTS}: Our search yielded 4,869 citations, with 13 studies meeting eligibility criteria. These 13 studies were conducted in 10 countries, and eight (62\%) were published since 2008. Across the 13 studies, the mean total sleep time of patients in the {ICU}, as estimated using actigraphy, ranged from 4.4 to 7.8 hours at nighttime and from 7.1 to 12.1 hours over a 24-hour period, with 1.4 to 49.0 mean nocturnal awakenings and a sleep efficiency of 61 to 75\%. When compared side-by-side with other measures of sleep (polysomnography, nurse assessments, and patient questionnaires), actigraphy consistently yielded higher total sleep time and sleep efficiency, fewer nighttime awakenings (vs. polysomnography), and more overall awakenings (vs. nurse assessment and patient questionnaires). None of the studies evaluated the association between actigraphy-based measures of sleep and outcomes of patients in the {ICU}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In critically ill patients, actigraphy is being used more frequently as a surrogate measure of sleep; however, because actigraphy only measures gross motor activity, its ability to estimate sleep is limited by the processing algorithm used. Prior {ICU}-based studies involving actigraphy were heterogeneous and lacked data regarding actigraphy-based measures of sleep and patient outcomes. Larger, more rigorous and standardized studies are needed to better understand the role of actigraphy in evaluating sleep and sleep-related outcomes in critically ill patients.},

Actigraphy is a tool that can be used to quantify these disturbances. The aim of this manuscript was to present the literature where actigraphy has been used to measure sleep and sleep-wake rhythms in relation to surgery.
{METHODS}: A systematic review was performed in 3 databases (Medline, Embase, and Psycinfo), including all literature until July 2012.
{RESULTS}: Thirty-two studies were included in the review. Actigraphy could demonstrate that total sleep time and sleep efficiency was reduced after surgery and number of awakenings was increased in patients undergoing major surgery. Disturbances were less severe in patients undergoing minor surgery. Actigraphy could be used to differentiate between delirious and non-delirious patients after major surgery. Actigraphy measurements could determine a differential effect of surgery based on the patient's age. The effect of pharmacological interventions (chronobiotics and hypnotics) in surgical patients could also be demonstrated by actigraphy.
{CONCLUSION}: Actigraphy can be used to measure sleep and sleep-wake rhythms in patients undergoing surgery.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Estimation of sleep parameters by wrist actigraphy is highly dependent on performance of the interpretative algorithm ({IA}) that converts movement data into sleep/wake scores.
{RESEARCH} {QUESTIONS}: (1) Does the actigraphy mode of operation -Proportional Integrating Measure ({PIM}) or Zero Crossing Mode ({ZCM}), responsive respectively to intensity and frequency of movements- impact sleep scoring; and (2) Can a better performing sleep scoring {IA} be developed by a deep learning approach combining {PIM}/{ZCM} data.
{STUDY} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: {ZCM} and {PIM} plus electroencephalographic ({EEG}) data of 40 healthy adults (17 female, mean age: 26.7 years) were obtained from a single in-home nighttime sleep study. Effect of mode of operation was first evaluated by applying several classic deep learning models to {PIM} only, {ZCM} only, and combined {ZCM}/{PIM} data. After, a novel deep learning model was developed incorporating combined {ZCM}/{PIM} data, and its performance was compared with existing Cole-Kripke, rescored Cole-Kripke, Sadeh, and {UCSD} {IAs}.
{RESULTS}: Relative to the {EEG} reference, {ZCM}/{PIM} combined mode produced higher agreement of scoring sleep/wake epochs than only {ZCM} or {PIM} modes. The proposed novel deep learning model showed 87.7\% accuracy (0.2-1\% higher than the other {IAs}), 94.1\% sensitivity (0.7-4.3\% lower than the other {IAs}), 64.0\% specificity (9.9-21.5\% higher than the other {IAs}), and 59.9\% Kappa agreement (∼6.9-11.6\% higher than other {IAs}) in detecting sleep epochs. The proposed deep learning model did not differ significantly from the reference {EEG} in estimating sleep onset latency ({SOL}), wake after sleep onset ({WASO}), total sleep time ({TST}), and sleep efficiency ({SE}). Amount of bias and minimum detectable change in estimating {SOL}, {WASO}, {TST} and {SE} by the deep learning model was smaller than other four {IAs}.
{INTERPRETATION}: The proposed novel deep learning algorithm simultaneously incorporating {ZCM}/{PIM} mode data performs significantly better in assessing sleep than existing conventional {IAs}.},

A total of 141 articles (110 unique samples), including 592 215 unique participants from 40 different countries, met inclusion criteria. Overall, longer sleep duration was associated with lower adiposity indicators, better emotional regulation, better academic achievement, and better quality of life/well-being. The evidence was mixed and/or limited for the association between sleep duration and cognition, harms/injuries, and cardiometabolic biomarkers. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high across study designs and health indicators. In conclusion, we confirmed previous investigations showing that shorter sleep duration is associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes. However, the available evidence relies heavily on cross-sectional studies using self-reported sleep. To better inform contemporary sleep recommendations, there is a need for sleep restriction/extension interventions that examine the changes in different outcome measures against various amounts of objectively measured sleep to have a better sense of dose-response relationships.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The objective of this systematic review was to examine for the first time the associations between sleep duration and a broad range of health indicators in children aged 0 to 4 years.
{METHODS}: Electronic databases were searched with no limits on date or study design. Included studies (published in English or French) were peer-reviewed and met the a priori determined population (apparently healthy children aged 1 month to 4.99 years), intervention/exposure/comparator (various sleep durations), and outcome criteria (adiposity, emotional regulation, cognitive development, motor development, growth, cardiometabolic health, sedentary behaviour, physical activity, quality of life/well-being, and risks/injuries). The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) framework. Due to high levels of heterogeneity across studies, narrative syntheses were employed.
{RESULTS}: A total of 69 articles/studies (62 unique samples) met inclusion criteria. Data across studies included 148,524 unique participants from 23 countries. The study designs were randomized trials (n = 3), non-randomized interventions (n = 1), longitudinal studies (n = 16), cross-sectional studies (n = 42), or longitudinal studies that also reported cross-sectional analyses (n = 7). Sleep duration was assessed by parental report in 70\% of studies (n = 48) and was measured objectively (or both objectively and subjectively) in 30\% of studies (n = 21). Overall, shorter sleep duration was associated with higher adiposity (20/31 studies), poorer emotional regulation (13/25 studies), impaired growth (2/2 studies), more screen time (5/5 studies), and higher risk of injuries (2/3 studies). The evidence related to cognitive development, motor development, physical activity, and quality of life/well-being was less clear, with no indicator showing consistent associations. No studies examined the association between sleep duration and cardiometabolic biomarkers in children aged 0 to 4 years. The quality of evidence ranged from "very low" to "high" across study designs and health indicators.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Despite important limitations in the available evidence, longer sleep duration was generally associated with better body composition, emotional regulation, and growth in children aged 0 to 4 years. Shorter sleep duration was also associated with longer screen time use and more injuries. Better-quality studies with stronger research designs that can provide information on dose-response relationships are needed to inform contemporary sleep duration recommendations.},

{METHODS}: We performed simulation studies based on three clinical cohorts: 1282 patients with head and neck cancer (with 46.9\% 5 year survival), 1731 patients with traumatic brain injury (22.3\% 6 month mortality) and 3181 patients with minor head injury (7.6\% with {CT} scan abnormalities). We compared three relatively modern modelling techniques: support vector machines ({SVM}), neural nets ({NN}), and random forests ({RF}) and two classical techniques: logistic regression ({LR}) and classification and regression trees ({CART}). We created three large artificial databases with 20 fold, 10 fold and 6 fold replication of subjects, where we generated dichotomous outcomes according to different underlying models. We applied each modelling technique to increasingly larger development parts (100 repetitions). The area under the {ROC}-curve ({AUC}) indicated the performance of each model in the development part and in an independent validation part. Data hungriness was defined by plateauing of {AUC} and small optimism (difference between the mean apparent {AUC} and the mean validated {AUC} {\textless}0.01).
{RESULTS}: We found that a stable {AUC} was reached by {LR} at approximately 20 to 50 events per variable, followed by {CART}, {SVM}, {NN} and {RF} models. Optimism decreased with increasing sample sizes and the same ranking of techniques. The {RF}, {SVM} and {NN} models showed instability and a high optimism even with {\textgreater}200 events per variable.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Modern modelling techniques such as {SVM}, {NN} and {RF} may need over 10 times as many events per variable to achieve a stable {AUC} and a small optimism than classical modelling techniques such as {LR}. This implies that such modern techniques should only be used in medical prediction problems if very large data sets are available.},

As a result, several software products offer nowadays automated or semi-automated scoring services. However, the vast majority of the sleep physicians do not use them. Very recently, thanks to the increased computational power, deep learning has also been employed with promising results. Machine learning algorithms can undoubtedly reach a high accuracy in specific situations, but there are many difficulties in their introduction in the daily routine. In this review, the latest approaches that are applying deep learning for facilitating and accelerating sleep scoring are thoroughly analyzed and compared with the state of the art methods. Then the obstacles in introducing automated sleep scoring in the clinical practice are examined. Deep learning algorithm capabilities of learning from a highly heterogeneous dataset, in terms both of human data and of scorers, are very promising and should be further investigated.},

For evaluating the manual annotation method, we calculated the inter- and intra-rater agreement and agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries using interclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. Our results showed excellent inter- and intra-rater agreement and excellent agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries. The Bland-Altman limits of agreement were generally around ±30 min for the comparison between the manual annotation and the Zmachine timestamps for the in-bed period. Moreover, the mean bias was minuscule. We conclude that the manual annotation method presented is a viable option for annotating in-bed periods in accelerometer data, which will further qualify datasets without labeling or sleep records.},

	title = {Automated detection of sleep-boundary times using wrist-worn accelerometry},
	url = {https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/935410},
	abstract = {Objective: Current polysomnography-validated measures of sleep status from wrist-worn accelerometers cannot be used in fully automated analysis as they rely on self-reported sleep-onset and -end (sleep-boundary) information. We set out to develop an automated, data-driven approach to sleep-boundary detection from wrist-worn accelerometer data. Methods: On three separate occasions, participants were asked to wear a {GENEActiv} wrist-worn accelerometer for nine days and concurrently complete sleep diaries with lights-off, asleep and wake-up information. We developed and evaluated three data-driven methods for sleep-boundary detection: a change-point detection based method, a thresholding method and a random forest classifier based method. Mean absolute errors between automatically-derived and self-reported sleep-onset and wake-up times were recorded in addition to kappa statistics for the minute-by-minute performance of each of the methods. Results: 46 participants provided 972 days of accelerometer recordings with corresponding self-reported sleep information. The three sleep-boundary detection methods resulted in mean absolute errors in sleep-onset and wake-up times per individual of 36 min, 34 min and 33 min and kappa statistics of 0.87, 0.89 and 0.89, respectively. Conclusion: Our methods provide a data-driven approach to detect sleep-onset and -end times without the need for self-reported sleep-boundary information. The methods are likely to be of particular use for large-scale studies where the collection of self-reported sleep diaries is impractical. Significance: Objective measures of sleep are needed to reliably detect associations with health outcomes. This work lays the foundation for studies of objectively measured sleep duration and its health consequences in large studies.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the criterion validity of an automated sleep detection algorithm applied to data from three research-grade accelerometers worn on each wrist with concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography ({PSG}). A total of 30 healthy volunteers (mean [{SD}] age 31.5 [7.2] years, body mass index 25.5 [3.7] kg/m2 ) wore an Axivity, {GENEActiv} and {ActiGraph} accelerometer on each wrist during a 1-night {PSG} assessment. Sleep estimates (sleep period time window [{SPT}-window], sleep duration, sleep onset and waking time, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset [{WASO}]) were generated using the automated sleep detection algorithm within the open-source {GGIR} package. Agreement of sleep estimates from accelerometer data with {PSG} was determined using pairwise 95\% equivalence tests (±10\% equivalence zone), intraclass correlation coefficients ({ICCs}) with 95\% confidence intervals and limits of agreement ({LoA}). Accelerometer-derived sleep estimates except for {WASO} were within the 10\% equivalence zone of the {PSG}. Reliability between data from the accelerometers worn on either wrist and {PSG} was moderate for {SPT}-window duration ({ICCs} ≥ 0.65), sleep duration ({ICCs} ≥ 0.54), and sleep onset ({ICCs} ≥ 0.61), mostly good for waking time ({ICCs} ≥ 0.80), but poor for sleep efficiency ({ICCs} ≥ 0.08) and {WASO} ({ICCs} ≥ 0.08). The mean bias between all accelerometer-derived sleep estimates worn on either wrist and {PSG} were low; however, wide 95\% {LoA} were observed for all sleep estimates, apart from waking time. The automated sleep detection algorithm applied to data from Axivity, {GENEActiv} and {ActiGraph} accelerometers, worn on either wrist, provides comparable measures to {PSG} for {SPT}-window and sleep duration, sleep onset and waking time, but a poor measure of wake during the sleep period.},

	doi = {10.2188/jea.je20120012},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Self-report remains the most practical and cost-effective method for epidemiologic sleep studies involving large population-based samples. Several validated questionnaires have been developed to assess sleep, but these tools are lengthy to administer and may be impractical for epidemiologic studies. We examined whether a 3-item sleep questionnaire, similar to those typically used in epidemiologic studies, closely corresponded with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy monitoring.
{METHODS}: Eligible participants were Western Australian women aged 18 to 80 years. Participants completed a sleep questionnaire, wore a wrist actigraph for 7 nights, and completed a brief daily sleep log. Objective actigraphy measurements for 56 participants were summarized by mean and mode and compared with the subjective reports, using weighted kappa and delta.
{RESULTS}: Data collected from the questionnaire showed poor agreement with objectively measured sleep, with kappas ranging from -0.19 to 0.14.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results indicate that sleep questions typically used in epidemiologic studies do not closely correspond with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy. The findings have implications for studies that have used such sleep questions. A means of appropriately measuring sleep as a risk factor in epidemiologic studies remains to be determined.},
