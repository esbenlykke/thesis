Precision-recall curves depicting the performance of the awake/asleep during in-bed time classification task. 

![Precision-recall curves of the models evaluated across the different ZM predictions, including raw ZM predictions, as well as 5-minute and 10-minute median smoothing of the ZM raw predictions. The x-axis of the plot represents the proportion of true wake epochs that were correctly classified as wake, while the y-axis represents the proportion of all epochs labeled as wake by the classifier that were classified correctly. The area under the curve values are displayed as color-coded text in the plot indicate the area under the Precision-Recall curve for each model and condition.](~/projects/sleep_study/manuscript/visuals/plot_sleep_pr.pdf){#fig-pr_curves}

![Receiver operating characteristic curves of the models evaluated across the different ZM predictions, including raw ZM predictions, as well as 5-minute and 10-minute median smoothing of the ZM raw predictions. The x-axis of the plot represents the proportion of true asleep epochs that were incorrectly classified as awake, while the y-axis represents the proportion of all epochs labeled as awake by the classifier that were correctly classified.
