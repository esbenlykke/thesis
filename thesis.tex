\section{Preface}\label{preface}}

The journey of my PhD has been a fulfilling expedition, layered with
explorations, discoveries, struggles, and growth. This endeavor was
fueled by my interest in understanding the objective measurements of
physical behavior and sleep. During my Masters, I found myself
increasingly engrossed in these domains.

My subsequent role as a research assistant at Aarhus University opened
another dimension of learning for me. The works of my peers, employing
machine learning and advanced statistics on accelerometer data,
intrigued me. It was as if I found the nexus of my research interests, a
perfect alignment that seamlessly fused my curiosities and passions.

One of the most significant hurdles was my limited experience with
programming and machine learning, which proved to be a steep learning
curve. However, through persistence, I slowly developed the necessary
skills to analyze and interpret my data effectively. Another major
setback was the failed data collection for my third paper. I spent
months visiting families, mounting an ambulatory PSG device on children
before bedtime, and facing the harsh reality of dealing with poor data
quality.

This thesis brings together my explorations and findings across three
papers that carry a consistent emphasis on improving and validating
methods to leverage accelerometer data for studying human behaviors. The
common thread across these papers is the application of innovative
methods, particularly machine learning techniques, to enhance the
utility, reliability, and accuracy of free-living accelerometer data for
monitoring human sleep and physical activity. The work presented here
constitutes a substantial contribution to the field of sleep and
physical activity research, particularly in the context of large-scale
studies.

Two of these papers have already found their place in peer-reviewed
scientific journals, and the third is under review. All of these works
are included as appendices to this thesis, and their content has been
weaved into the fabric of this thesis.

As I look back at my journey through the PhD program, I am grateful for
this opportunity to delve deep into a subject that I am passionate about
and to contribute to a field that is evolving rapidly. This experience
has instilled in me a sense of tenacity and patience, qualities that I
have come to value deeply. I learned that even the most frustrating
problems have solutions, and the path to those solutions often leads to
personal growth and novel insights.

As I stand on the precipice of my future, I am filled with a sense of
anticipation and excitement for the possibilities that lie ahead. I am
eager to explore new horizons, to encounter new challenges, and to
continue growing as a researcher and as an individual. However, wherever
I go and whatever I do, I will carry with me the memories, experiences,
and lessons from this incredible journey.

These years have shaped me in ways I could never have imagined at the
outset, and for that, I am profoundly grateful. As I close this chapter
of my life, I do so with a sense of accomplishment and a promise of
continued exploration and discovery in my field. After all, every ending
is but a new beginning, and I look forward to the adventures that await.

Throughout the course of a single day, a variety of activities encompass
physical behaviors including sleep, physical activity (PA), and
sedentary behavior\autocite{rollo_whole_2020}. Over the last decade,
numerous studies have highlighted the unique health advantages of high
PA levels, especially moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA)\autocite{kraus_physical_2019,lee_effect_2012}, minimal sedentary
periods\autocite{wilmot_sedentary_2012}, and adequate
sleep\autocite{cappuccio_sleep_2010}. The robust evidence highlighting
the health benefits of optimal sleep and daily moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA) has led to the formation of public guidelines
such as the American recommendation of 150 minutes of MVPA per
week\autocite{kl_physical_2018}, and the Danish suggestion of 30 minutes
of MVPA per day for adults\autocite{el-zine_fysisk_voksne} and 60
minutes per day for children\autocite{el-zine_fysisk_børn}. Furthermore,
it's advised that adults get 7-8 hours of
sleep\autocite{consensus_conference_panel_recommended_2015}, whereas
children aged 6-12 should sleep 9-12 hours and teenagers aged 13-18
should aim for 8-10 hours of sleep
regularly\autocite{paruthi_consensus_2016}. A growing body of evidence
suggesting a link between high sedentary periods and negative health
outcomes has led to guidelines advocating for decreasing and
interrupting sitting time\autocite{tremblay_sedentary_2017}.
Traditionally, the relationship between time spent on each of these
behaviors throughout a 24-hour cycle and health outcomes has been
studied separately, neglecting the potential inter-connectedness of
these activities\autocite{rosenberger_24-hour_2019}.

Previous research has shown that, apart from the many health benefits
linked to maintaining sufficient PA levels, it also correlates with
improved sleep duration and quality\autocite{kredlow_effects_2015}. As
expected, there is also evidence suggesting that better sleep may
encourage increased
PA\autocite{lambiase_temporal_2013,mcglinchey_physical_2014}, with a
rising number of studies indicating a connection between these two
behaviors\autocite{dolezal_interrelationship_2017,chennaoui_sleep_2015}.
Various studies have observed daily correlations between PA and
sleep\autocite{pettee_gabriel_bidirectional_2017,kishida_intensive_2016}.
However, these findings have shown inconsistencies, largely attributed
to the varied measurement methodologies. Traditionally, data on time
spent on different physical behaviors has been gathered using
self-reported tools such as questionnaires, diaries, or
interviews\autocite{dowd_systematic_2018}. In addition to recall and
response bias, the challenges of self-reporting include the difficulty
of monitoring multiple behaviors
simultaneously\autocite{rosenberger_24-hour_2019}. As a result, most
published research has generally focused on a single behavior. Some of
these limitations can be addressed with 24-hour accelerometer-based
protocols, especially those worn on the wrist (9). Wrist accelerometers
are small, non-invasive, waterproof (18), allowing for continuous,
24-hour wear with minimal disruption to the wearer, and permit
uninterrupted activity measurement throughout the day, thereby tracking
and analyzing daily changes in PA and sleep behaviors. Furthermore, the
latest accelerometers supply raw acceleration data that can be processed
using open-source analytical techniques to produce estimates of sleep,
sedentary behavior, and PA (19). Simultaneous measurement of physical
behaviors, particularly feasible with wrist accelerometry, can offer a
better comprehension of the influence of these behaviors on health
indicators and their interrelationships. This data could be critical in
shaping future health recommendations or interventions.

Utilizing machine learning for sleep and physical activity
identification from accelerometry data is a burgeoning field. This
approach offers potential to model complex non-linear relationships
unattainable with simple statistical methods such as multiple linear or
logistic regression \autocite{fiorillo_automated_2019}. However,
supervised machine learning requires large amounts of accurately
annotated data to ensure accuracy and
generalizability\autocite{van_der_ploeg_modern_2014}.

Sleep is considered a vital element for the overall health and
development of
children\autocite{chaput_systematic_2017,chaput_systematic_2016,st-onge_sleep_2016}.
Healthy sleep is characterized by sufficient duration, appropriate
timing, quality, and absence of disturbances or
disorders\autocite{gruber_position_2014}. Despite its importance, the
use of advanced machine learning techniques to assess sleep measures
from accelerometer data remains
underdeveloped\autocite{haghayegh_application_2020}.

Accelerometry provides an affordable and minimally invasive method to
analyze sleep patterns. Objective measurements are crucial for insights
into individual and population-wide circadian rhythms. Polysomnography
(PSG), the gold standard for objective sleep assessment, records
electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG), and
electrooculographic (EOG) activity. However, PSG is costly and
burdensome due to technician support requirements, intrusive sensor
placements, and overnight monitoring\autocite{vaughn_technical_2008}.

Recent studies have tried to use machine learning techniques for
PSG-assessed sleep-wake classification with wrist
acceleration\autocite{haghayegh_application_2020,sundararajan_sleep_2021,hees_novel_2015}.
Sundararajan et al.\autocite{sundararajan_sleep_2021} used a random
forest machine learning algorithm, achieving an F1 score of 73.9\%.
However, the high false discovery rate indicates limitations in
wrist-worn accelerometers, possibly due to the lack of subject variation
and the use of single-night PSG-recordings.

To overcome these limitations, researchers should increase the number of
subjects and recording days to capture more variation in movement
behavior during sleep. Accelerometry, despite its limitations, is
practical for extended recordings outside of the lab
\autocite{van_de_water_objective_2011}. The focus should be on
developing algorithms for sleep timing rather than sleep staging.

Identifying sleep/wake cycles from accelerometry data requires time in
bed annotation, when participants go to bed and wake up. Although this
isn't actual sleep time, accelerometry is still widely used in sleep
research due to its practical advantages
\autocite{hees_novel_2015,madsen_actigraphy_2013,schwab_actigraphy_2018,barouni_ambulatory_2020}
This annotation could be based on individual sleep diaries, EEG-based
recordings \autocite{younes_staging_2016}, or systems for recording
tracheal sounds
\autocite{dafna_sleep-wake_2015,montazeri_ghahjaverestan_sleepwakefulness_2020}.

This study aims to (1) describe a method for manual annotation of
bedtime and wake-up time with raw accelerometry, (2) evaluate the
accuracy of manual annotation against a single-channel EEG-based sleep
staging system and sleep diary, and (3) assess the inter- and
intra-rater reliability of annotations.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

The use of body-worn motion sensors, especially accelerometers, to study
human physical activity behavior has gained significant popularity over
recent years, offering an efficient and cost-effective method for
capturing objective movement data
\autocite{dowd_systematic_2018,loyen_sedentary_2017,montoye_raw_2018,migueles_comparability_2019}.
These devices can be worn during various activities with some protocols
allowing detachment during water-based activities, sleep, or certain
sports to prevent injury.

However, such detachment periods, referred to as non-wear time, present
researchers with a challenge in the form of missing data. Non-wear time
can significantly influence the outcomes derived from the acceleration
measurements \autocite{lee_missing_2018}. While some researchers exclude
these periods or attempt to impute the missing data using various
methods, such strategies can introduce bias, particularly when non-wear
times are longer. This issue underscores the importance of accurately
classifying and handling non-wear periods for reliable estimates of
subjects' physical activity behavior during free-living
\autocite{lee_missing_2018}.

The classification of non-wear periods can be acquired by having
subjects keep individual log diaries, although this method can be
cumbersome and potentially error-prone
\autocite{ainsworth_recommendations_2012}. In a bid to reduce subject
burden and enhance accuracy, researchers have employed rule-based
methods and advanced algorithms to classify non-wear time
\autocite{hecht_methodology_2009,ruiz_objectively_2011,troiano_physical_2008}.
Yet, such methods can yield disparate physical activity and sedentary
behavior aggregates depending on non-wear settings, age, and obesity
level, limiting their utility and the ability to make comparisons across
studies \autocite{aadland_comparison_2018,toftager_accelerometer_2013}.

Advancements in accelerometer technology in recent years have enabled
researchers to store raw accelerations, enhancing data granularity and
potentially improving non-wear period classification
\autocite{duncan_wear-time_2018,rasmussen_short-term_2020,zhou_classification_2015}.
However, even with access to higher quantity and quality data, simple
duration-based algorithms carry the risk of falsely misclassifying true
non-wear as inactivity, restricting the ability to detect non-wear
episodes shorter than the designated interval.

Recently, studies have explored the potential of machine learning,
including random forests and deep learning techniques, to classify
non-wear using raw accelerometer data
\autocite[\textcite{syed_novel_2021}]{sundararajan_sleep_2021}. Machine
learning algorithms aim to learn patterns from the training data and
approximate the complex model that best describes the relationship
between the predictors and the outcome. The balance between model
variance and bias is a critical consideration in this process, with the
ultimate goal of optimizing the predictive performance of a
machine-learned model on unseen data.

Despite the performance of models utilizing complex machine learning
algorithms on testing data, their performance on external unseen data
remains largely unknown. This gap in knowledge is often due to a lack of
out-of-distribution data sources and the desire to incorporate all
available data into model training to maximize information capture. Some
studies have utilized surface skin temperature in conjunction with raw
acceleration for non-wear classification
\autocite{duncan_wear-time_2018,zhou_classification_2015}, but the
performance and generalizability of adding surface skin temperature with
advanced machine learning methods have yet to be explored.

Despite technological advancements, there is still room for improvement
in accurately classifying non-wear time in raw accelerometer data. It
prompts the question: what heuristic algorithm or machine-learned model
will perform best on unseen data for classifying non-wear time? To
address this, we created three datasets of raw accelerometer data with
correctly labeled wear- and non-wear time, including surface skin
temperature measurements. Our study aims to (1) train three decision
tree models on accelerometer data from thigh and hip-worn accelerometers
for non-wear time classification and evaluate the importance of surface
skin temperature and minimizing the number of predictors provided to the
model, and (2) assess the performance of machine-learned models and
simple heuristic algorithms across datasets of varying age ranges for
non-wear time classification.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

A vast body of research highlights the critical role of sleep in
maintaining both mental and physical
health\autocite{ma_sleep_2017,meyer_circadian_2022,k_pavlova_sleep_2019,difrancesco_sleep_2019}.
Consequently, accurate sleep assessment methods are crucial for tracking
sleep patterns and improving our understanding of the sleep-health
relationship. Furthermore, the ease of use and high acceptability of
these methods are essential to facilitate large-scale, longitudinal
studies.

The traditional gold standard for objective sleep measurement,
laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG), has been found to be impractical
in large-scale epidemiological studies due to its high cost, need for
professional administration, and susceptibility to rater
bias\autocite{van_de_water_objective_2011,lee_interrater_2022}. As an
alternative, diaries have been used due to their cost-effectiveness and
simplicity, although they are subject to recall bias and other
limitations\autocite{moore_actigraphy_2015}. An innovative approach
involves device-based measurement methods. These tools, which estimate
sleep duration, are advantageous due to their reduced participant burden
and elimination of potential recall biases. A prominent example of such
tools is body-worn accelerometers, which offer a practical and
affordable means of objectively assessing sleep patterns at home for
extended periods. Accelerometers collect continuous, high-resolution
data for several weeks without requiring recharging, further minimizing
participant burden. Their use in sleep and wake classification began
with a wrist movement-based algorithm developed in 1982, and validated
using PSG\autocite{webster_activity-based_1982}. This algorithm was
refined in 1992\autocite{cole_automatic_1992}, leading to the widely
adopted Cole-Kripke model. With advancements in the field, a variety of
techniques, including heuristic algorithms, machine learning models,
regression, and deep learning, are now used to analyze data from hip and
wrist-worn
accelerometers\autocite{palotti_benchmark_2019,cole_automatic_1992,sazonov_activity-based_2004,sadeh_activity-based_1994,hees_novel_2015,sundararajan_sleep_2021}.

While wrist and hip-worn devices have benefited from extensive
methodological development, thigh-worn accelerometers have not seen the
same level of advancement. Existing studies mainly focus on
distinguishing sleep from wakefulness, with emphasis on defining `waking
time' and `bedtime'
\autocite{carlson_validity_2021,inan-eroglu_comparison_2021,van_der_berg_identifying_2016,winkler_identifying_2016}.
Recent strides in estimating sleep duration using thigh-worn devices
have been made, including the introduction of a promising algorithm and
its comparison against PSG\autocite{johansson_development_2023}. Despite
these advancements, the application of machine learning techniques in
this area is still unexplored. Considering the potential of thigh-worn
accelerometers for accurate physical behavior
assessment\autocite{skotte_detection_2014,arvidsson_re-examination_2019},
there is a significant research gap. Therefore, future studies need to
develop techniques similar to those used for wrist and hip-worn
accelerometers, with the ultimate goal of establishing a more holistic,
accurate, and user-friendly method of sleep and physical activity
tracking.

The Zmachine®️ Insight+ (ZM) emerges as a valuable tool within this
landscape. Favorably validated against
PSG\autocite{kaplan_performance_2014,wang_evaluation_2015}, the ZM
provides comparable data without the high costs or the need for
professional monitoring typically associated with PSG. Crucially, the ZM
facilitates multi-night analysis in free-living conditions due to its
ease of use\autocite{pedersen_self-administered_2021}, capturing the
natural variations in sleep patterns. This makes it advantageous over
single-night PSG, particularly as a gold standard data source in machine
learning tasks, as it provides multiple nights of measurements without
inter-rater bias. Despite these benefits, the ZM, like PSG, still poses
a significant participant burden and cost, reinforcing the need for more
accessible alternatives like accelerometers.

Our primary objective in this study was to evaluate a range of machine
learning and deep learning models, utilizing the raw data collected from
a tri-axial thigh-worn accelerometer to estimate in-bed and sleep time.
To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of our models, we compared
their outputs with an electroencephalography-based (EEG) sleep tracking
device, which we, in this current study, considered as the gold standard
for measuring sleep. Furthermore, our secondary goal was to assess the
developed models' performance in evaluating important sleep quality
metrics, including sleep period time (SPT), total sleep time (TST),
sleep efficiency (SE), latency until persistent sleep (LPS), and wake
after sleep onset (WASO).
