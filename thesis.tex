\vspace*{\baselineskip}

The journey of my PhD has been a fulfilling expedition, layered with explorations, discoveries, struggles, and growth. This endeavor was fueled by my interest in understanding the objective measurements of physical behavior and sleep. During my Masters, I found myself increasingly engrossed in these domains.

My subsequent role as a research assistant at Aarhus University opened another dimension of learning for me. The works of my peers, employing machine learning and advanced statistics on accelerometer data, intrigued me. It was as if I found the nexus of my research interests, a perfect alignment that seamlessly fused my curiosities and passions.

One of the most significant hurdles was my limited experience with programming and machine learning, which proved to be a steep learning curve. However, through persistence, I slowly developed the necessary skills to analyze and interpret my data effectively. Another major setback was the failed data collection for my third paper. I spent months visiting families, mounting an ambulatory PSG device on children before bedtime, and facing the harsh reality of dealing with poor data quality.

This thesis brings together my explorations and findings across three papers that carry a consistent emphasis on improving and validating methods to leverage accelerometer data for studying human behaviors. The common thread across these papers is the application of innovative methods, particularly machine learning techniques, to enhance the utility, reliability, and accuracy of free-living accelerometer data for monitoring human sleep and physical activity. The work presented here constitutes a substantial contribution to the field of sleep and physical activity research, particularly in the context of large-scale studies.

Two of these papers have already found their place in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and the third is under review. All of these works are included as appendices to this thesis, and their content has been weaved into the fabric of this thesis.

As I look back at my journey through the PhD program, I am grateful for this opportunity to delve deep into a subject that I am passionate about and to contribute to a field that is evolving rapidly. This experience has instilled in me a sense of tenacity and patience, qualities that I have come to value deeply. I learned that even the most frustrating problems have solutions, and the path to those solutions often leads to personal growth and novel insights.

As I stand on the precipice of my future, I am filled with a sense of anticipation and excitement for the possibilities that lie ahead. I am eager to explore new horizons, to encounter new challenges, and to continue growing as a researcher and as an individual. However, wherever I go and whatever I do, I will carry with me the memories, experiences, and lessons from this incredible journey.

These years have shaped me in ways I could never have imagined at the outset, and for that, I am profoundly grateful. As I close this chapter of my life, I do so with a sense of accomplishment and a promise of continued exploration and discovery in my field. After all, every ending is but a new beginning, and I look forward to the adventures that await.

  The importance of sleep and physical activity tracking in health
  research.
\end{itemize}

Physical behaviors throughout a day encompass a range of activities,
including sleep, physical activity (PA), and sedentary behavior.
Numerous studies over the past decade have underscored the health
benefits of optimal sleep, high PA levels, especially
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kraus_physical_2019}{1},\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee_effect_2012}{2}},
minimal sedentary
periods\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wilmot_sedentary_2012}{3}},
and adequate
sleep\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cappuccio_sleep_2010}{4}}.
This robust evidence has informed public
guidelines\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-borodulin_physical_2023}{5}},
such as the American recommendation of 150 minutes of MVPA per
week\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kl_physical_2018}{6}}, and
the Danish guideline suggesting 30 minutes of MVPA daily for
adults\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-el-zine_fysisk_nodate-1}{7}}
and 60 minutes for
children\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-el-zine_fysisk_nodate}{8}}.

The integration of sleep and physical activity tracking in health
research is paramount for a comprehensive understanding of individual
well-being. Over the years, the significance of both sleep and physical
activity in maintaining optimal health has been increasingly
acknowledged\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kraus_physical_2019}{1},\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee_effect_2012}{2},\protect\hyperlink{ref-liguori_evolving_2023}{9}}.
These elements are foundational to our well-being, influencing a
spectrum of health aspects from mental
health\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-biddle_physical_2011}{10}}
to physical
fitness\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-warburton_health_2017}{11}},
and even disease
prevention\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-strath_guide_2013}{12},\protect\hyperlink{ref-arem_leisure_2015}{13}}.

With the advent of wearable technology and advanced tracking systems,
researchers now possess tools that allow for an in-depth exploration of
the intricate relationship between sleep, physical activity, and overall
health\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rollo_whole_2020}{14}}.
Traditional health assessments might have primarily focused on diet,
weight, or blood pressure. However, by incorporating data on sleep and
physical activity, we can achieve a more holistic understanding of
health. For instance, sleep deprivation is associated with a range of
health issues, from weight gain and decreased immune function to an
increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular
disease\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-warburton_health_2017}{11}}.

Building on this, the ability to monitor sleep and physical activity has
revolutionized personalized health interventions. For example, if data
reveals interrupted sleep patterns, interventions can be customized to
address these specific issues. Similarly, if someone isn't achieving
their physical activity targets, strategies can be formulated to boost
their activity levels, potentially enhancing health
outcomes\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenberger_24-hour_2019}{15}}.
Furthermore, tracking these patterns provides researchers with insights
into the mechanisms of various diseases and health conditions. Early
detection of conditions like sleep apnea, characterized by intermittent
breathing pauses during sleep, can lead to timely management, preventing
a cascade of health
complications\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cappuccio_sleep_2010}{4}}.
For patients undergoing treatments, such as those with depression who
often face sleep disturbances, tracking becomes vital. It allows
healthcare providers to assess the effectiveness of interventions,
whether they're antidepressant medications or other therapeutic
strategies\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-paruthi_consensus_2016}{16}}.

In today's medical landscape, there's a pronounced focus on preventive
healthcare. The principle is clear: it's better to prevent diseases than
to treat them after they manifest. Regular tracking of sleep and
physical activity can act as an early warning system, signaling
potential health risks before they develop into severe conditions. For
instance, consistent inactivity can heighten risks related to obesity,
heart disease, and other chronic
ailments\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-tremblay_sedentary_2017}{17}}.
Early detection through tracking can pave the way for timely
interventions and preventive
actions\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-liguori_evolving_2023}{9}}.

\hypertarget{measurement-of-physical-activity-and-sleep}{%
\subsection{Measurement of Physical Activity and
Sleep}\label{measurement-of-physical-activity-and-sleep}}

Physical activity and sleep are integral components of human behavior.
Physical activity is characterized by multiple dimensions such as
frequency, duration, intensity, and domains, making it challenging to
measure all its aspects (21). Similarly, sleep is essential for health,
and its accurate monitoring in terms of duration, quality, architecture,
and circadian patterns is crucial. Various techniques are available to
quantify both PA and sleep, broadly grouped into subjective and
objective methods.

\hypertarget{subjective-methods}{%
\subsubsection{Subjective Methods}\label{subjective-methods}}

Physical Activity Questionnaires and Diaries/Logs

In epidemiological studies, self-report methods, including PA
questionnaires and diaries, have been primary tools due to their low
cost, ease of use, and ability to capture the type and context of
PA(25). Despite their advantages, these methods can be prone to biases,
including reporting bias and misinterpretation, and may not always be
reliable(25).

Sleep Questionnaires and Diaries

Subjective sleep quality can be assessed using tools like the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index, reflecting one's satisfaction with sleep over a
specified period, such as a month(78). While they are practical and
cost-effective, self-report sleep assessments can overestimate sleep
duration and may not capture all nuances of sleep quality(79). Sleep
diaries, often regarded as the ``gold standard'' for subjective sleep
assessment, provide daily insights but are dependent on memory and
participant adherence(82).

\hypertarget{objective-methods}{%
\subsubsection{Objective Methods}\label{objective-methods}}

Direct Observation and Polysomnography (PSG)

Direct observation allows researchers to record an individual's PA and
sleep behaviors, capturing intricate details like frequency, duration,
and intensity(21). PSG, on the other hand, is the gold standard for
sleep measurement, monitoring various physiological aspects in a
controlled setting(78). Both methods, while comprehensive, can be costly
and labor-intensive.

Doubly Labelled Water Method

This method provides an estimate of total energy expenditure over
several days and is a gold standard for PA(25). It's a powerful tool but
comes with high costs and doesn't provide granular details on PA
dimensions(26).

Physiological Recordings

Heart rate (HR) recordings can be used to estimate PA intensity,
assuming a linear relationship between HR and PA intensity(27). While
relatively cost-effective, various external factors can influence HR,
making it less accurate for certain activities(27).

Device-based Methods: Pedometers, Accelerometers, and Actigraphy

Pedometers are simple devices that count steps and can provide
additional metrics like distance traveled and calories burned(21).
Accelerometers, such as GENEActiv and ActiGraph, offer detailed
recordings of raw triaxial linear acceleration data, capturing a wide
range of PA and sleep data(28). Wrist actigraphy, commonly used in sleep
research, measures wrist movements to assess sleep or waking state(85).
These devices are convenient and non-intrusive, but their data might
vary due to different technical characteristics, making direct
comparisons challenging(33).

\hypertarget{sleep-assessment-with-accelerometry}{%
\subsubsection{Sleep Assessment with
Accelerometry}\label{sleep-assessment-with-accelerometry}}

Wrist-worn accelerometers have become increasingly popular for PA
assessment. They have been developed separately from clinical wrist
actigraphy but offer the potential for dual PA and sleep data
collection(90). New algorithms, like the GGIR-package in R, combine
24-hour activity data, but they often require a sleep log for
accuracy(92). Some algorithms can detect sleep periods even without
sleep diaries, but their validation remains limited(93).

\end{itemize}

Some of these limitations can be addressed with 24-hour
accelerometer-based protocols, especially those worn on the
wrist\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenberger_24-hour_2019}{15}}.
Wrist accelerometers are small, non-invasive,
waterproof\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-welk_reliability_2004}{18}},
allowing for continuous, 24-hour wear with minimal disruption to the
wearer, and permit uninterrupted activity measurement throughout the
day, thereby tracking and analyzing daily changes in PA and sleep
behaviors. Furthermore, the latest accelerometers supply raw
acceleration data that can be processed using open-source analytical
techniques to produce estimates of sleep, sedentary behavior, and
PA\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-migueles_comparability_2019}{19}}.
Simultaneous measurement of physical behaviors, particularly feasible
with wrist accelerometry, can offer a better comprehension of the
influence of these behaviors on health indicators and their
interrelationships. This data could be critical in shaping future health
recommendations or interventions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Supervised learning and annotation of data sources
\end{itemize}

Machine learning stands at the crossroads of statistics and computer
science. It embodies the principles of discerning patterns and
relationships from data, a foundational tenet of statistics, while also
leveraging the power of efficient computing algorithms, a core concept
in computer
science\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hastie01statisticallearning}{20}}.
With the surge in data scale, encompassing billions or even trillions of
data points, this synergy becomes essential to navigate the intricate
landscape of data analysis.

One of the primary branches of machine learning is supervised learning.
Its primary objective is to predict known outputs based on inputs.
Real-world applications of supervised learning span across various
domains. For instance, in machine learning competitions, challenges
often include tasks such as handwriting recognition, image
classification (e.g., discerning between a cat and a dog), and document
categorization (e.g., differentiating between a clinical trial on heart
failure and a financial report). These tasks aim to emulate or even
surpass human capabilities in specific areas. Supervised learning
essentially revolves around two core concepts: classification
(categorizing data into predefined groups) and prediction (estimating
unknown parameters).

Delving deeper into its applications, consider the realm of physical
activity and sleep research. Here, supervised learning plays a pivotal
role. For instance, algorithms can automatically classify activity
levels---from sedentary to vigorous---using data from accelerometers.
Similarly, in sleep studies, such algorithms can discern between various
sleep stages like light sleep or REM, using accelerometer or actigraphy
data. While these machines emulate human analysts, their capabilities
can extend beyond, unveiling insights or patterns not immediately
visible to human researchers. A predictive model, for example, might
forecast the risk of metabolic syndrome based on sedentary time patterns
or predict sleep disorders from sleep pattern variations. (REFS P√Ö HELE
AFSNITTET)

The utilization of machine learning to decipher sleep and physical
activity from accelerometry data is gaining traction. Its capability to
model intricate non-linear relationships is unparalleled compared to
traditional statistical methods like linear
regression\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-fiorillo_automated_2019}{21}}.
Yet, the success of supervised learning hinges on abundant and
accurately annotated data for ensuring both precision and
applicability\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-van_der_ploeg_modern_2014}{22}}.

The significance of sleep, especially for children's health and
development, is
well-established\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-chaput_systematic_2017}{23}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-st-onge_sleep_2016}{25}}.
Healthy sleep encompasses several factors like duration, timing, and
quality\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-gruber_position_2014}{26}}.
Yet, the potential of advanced machine learning in evaluating sleep
using accelerometer data is still largely
untapped\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-haghayegh_application_2020}{27}}.

Despite the supremacy of Polysomnography (PSG) as the gold standard for
objective sleep analysis, its high costs, and intrusive nature
underscore the value of accelerometry---a less invasive and more
cost-effective
alternative\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-vaughn_technical_2008}{28}}.
Recent endeavors in this domain include PSG-assessed sleep-wake
classification using wrist-worn accelerometers. For example,
Sundararajan et
al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sundararajan_sleep_2021}{29}}
leveraged a random forest machine learning algorithm, achieving
commendable results. Yet, issues like high false discovery rates point
to challenges such as limited subject variation.

To address these challenges, there's a clear imperative to diversify the
sample base and extend recording durations. While accelerometry has its
limitations, its feasibility for prolonged, out-of-lab recordings makes
it
invaluable\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-van_de_water_objective_2011}{30}}.
Given these dynamics, the focus should lean towards sleep timing
algorithms rather than sleep staging.

A crucial aspect of deciphering sleep/wake cycles from accelerometry
data is the annotation of time in bed, which, although not indicative of
actual sleep duration, provides crucial insights. Such annotations can
stem from individual sleep diaries, EEG-based
recordings\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-younes_staging_2016}{31}},
or systems capturing tracheal
sounds\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-dafna_sleep-wake_2015}{32},\protect\hyperlink{ref-montazeri_ghahjaverestan_sleepwakefulness_2020}{33}}.
Given its practicality, accelerometry continues to be a staple in sleep
research, echoing its immense potential and
adaptability\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hees_novel_2015}{34}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-barouni_ambulatory_2020}{37}}.

\section{Paper I: Manual Annotation of Time in Bed Using Free-Living
Recordings of Accelerometry
Data}\label{paper-i-manual-annotation-of-time-in-bed-using-free-living-recordings-of-accelerometry-data}}

This segment of the thesis encompasses the methods, results, and
discussion for Paper I. The study underscores the importance of
effective machine learning algorithms for sleep/wake cycles, which
ideally necessitate correct data annotations over a span of 7-10 days.
Although sleep diaries or EEG recordings can annotate `time in bed',
many researches predominantly rely on accelerometry. This emphasizes the
imperative for enhanced annotation techniques and their validity. Our
objective is to introduce a manual annotation method, gauge its
precision, and determine its consistency. Some of the details presented
here were previously mentioned in the published version of Paper
I\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-skovgaard_manual_2021}{38}}.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{study-population}{%
\subsubsection{Study Population}\label{study-population}}

The data for this study was sourced from the SCREENS pilot trial
(www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03788525), a two-arm parallel-group
cluster-randomized trial with two intervention groups, conducted between
October 2018 and March
2019\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rasmussen_feasibility_2021}{39},\protect\hyperlink{ref-rasmussen_short-term_2020}{40}}.
There was no control group in this trial.

Families from the Middelfart municipality in Denmark were approached for
participation if they had a child aged between 6 to 10 years living with
them, out of a total of 1686 families. To qualify, the parent's screen
media usage had to exceed the median of 2.7 hours per day, based on
survey responses from 394 respondents. Additionally, all children in the
household needed to be older than 3.9 years to ensure that sleep
measurements weren't disrupted by the nocturnal awakenings typical of
infants or toddlers. For a comprehensive list of inclusion and exclusion
criteria, refer to Pedersen et
al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-pedersen_self-administered_2021}{41}}.

The study ultimately included data from 14 children and 19 adults. These
participants weren't advised to alter their sleep or bedtime routines
for the interventions. While the study focused on nightly sleep time as
recorded by the EEG-based sleep staging system, any napping behavior of
the participants was deemed irrelevant.

All data collection procedures were reported to the local data
protection department, SDU RIO (ID: 10.391), in compliance with the
Danish Data Protection Agency's regulations.

\hypertarget{actigraphy}{%
\subsubsection{Actigraphy}\label{actigraphy}}

Both adults and children participated in 24-hour accelerometry
recordings using two triaxial accelerometers, Axivity AX3 (Axivity Ltd.,
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The Axivity AX3 is a compact device, measuring
23 mm √ó 32.5 mm √ó 7.6 mm and weighing just 11 g. It was set with a
sensitivity of ¬±8 g and a sampling frequency of 50 Hz.

Participants wore the accelerometers at two specific anatomical
locations. The first was positioned on the right hip, secured in a
pocket attached to a belt around the waist, ensuring the USB connector
faced outward from the body's right side. The second accelerometer was
placed midway between the hip and knee on the right thigh, housed in a
pocket on a belt, with the USB connector also facing away from the body.

For both the baseline and follow-up, the devices were worn for a
duration of one week (seven consecutive days). This duration aligns with
the recommended number of days to reliably gauge habitual physical
activity\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-jaeschke_variability_2018}{42}}.

\hypertarget{zmachine-insight-sleep-assessments}{%
\subsubsection{Zmachine¬Æ Insight+ Sleep
Assessments}\label{zmachine-insight-sleep-assessments}}

Both adults and children were assessed for their sleep patterns using
the Zmachine¬Æ (ZM) Insight+ model DT-200 (General Sleep Corporation,
Cleveland, OH, USA), Firmware version 5.1.0. This assessment was
concurrent with the accelerometer recordings. At the baseline, the sleep
assessment spanned 3--4 nights, while during the follow-up, it was
conducted over 3 nights.

The ZM device operates by measuring sleep through a single-channel EEG,
specifically from the differential mastoid (A1--A2) EEG location,
evaluated on a 30-second epoch basis. Designed for use in everyday
settings, the ZM provides an objective measurement of various sleep
parameters, including sleep duration, sleep stage classification, and
latency to different sleep stages.

The ZM's algorithm has been benchmarked against polysomnography (PSG) in
laboratory settings for both adults with and without chronic sleep
issues\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wang_evaluation_2015}{43},\protect\hyperlink{ref-kaplan_performance_2014}{44}}.
Our findings indicate that the ZM is effectively applicable to both
children and adults for multi-day measurements in real-world
settings\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hees_novel_2015}{34}}.
Notably, the device showcased a high accuracy in distinguishing between
sleep and wakefulness, with sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, and negative predictive values being 95.5\%, 92.5\%,
98\%, and 84.2\%,
respectively\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kaplan_performance_2014}{44}}.

For the assessment, three electrodes (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark, type:
N-00-S/25) are positioned on the mastoids (for signal) and the nape (as
ground). About half an hour before their intended sleep time,
participants' skin areas are cleaned with alcohol swabs, after which the
electrodes are affixed. An EEG cable connects these electrodes to the ZM
device. A preliminary sensor check ensures all electrodes are correctly
mounted; any issues are promptly addressed by replacing the problematic
electrodes. Additionally, participants, or parents on behalf of their
children, recorded their sleep and wake times daily in a dedicated
diary.

\hypertarget{audacity}{%
\subsubsection{Audacity}\label{audacity}}

Audacity¬ÆÔ∏è is a distinguished free audio editing
software\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-audacity}{45}}. The
genesis of Audacity can be traced back to the fall of 1999, when it
emerged as an innovative project led by Dominic Mazzoni and Roger
Dannenberg at Carnegie Mellon University. By May 2000, it was unveiled
to the world as an open-source audio editor. Since its inception,
Audacity has undergone significant evolution. The software, developed
collaboratively by the community, now boasts of hundreds of unique
features, offers complete support for professional-grade 24-bit and
32-bit audio, has a comprehensive manual available in multiple
languages, and has witnessed distribution in the millions. Today, a
dedicated team of volunteers from various corners of the globe continues
to maintain and enhance Audacity. It is disseminated under the GNU
General Public License, granting everyone the freedom to utilize the
software for personal, educational, or commercial endeavors.

In the realm of accelerometer data analysis, Audacity stands out. It
furnishes researchers with the capability to meticulously scrutinize
high-resolution raw accelerometer data with unparalleled precision.
Users can quickly zoom in to delve deeper into specific segments of the
recording, like certain patterns around bedtime, or zoom out for a
broader perspective, such as data spanning a week. Furthermore,
Audacity's sophisticated labeling function is pivotal for annotating the
accelerometry data. Any generated labels can be preserved in an
individual file and later integrated into machine learning algorithms.
This level of detailed manual inspection of high-resolution
accelerometer data offered by Audacity is, based on our knowledge,
unparalleled by any other software.

Within the Audacity interface, there's the possibility of amalgamating
over 100 channels of data. This aids in the merging of distinct signal
features derived from acceleration. The integration of multiple signal
features is intriguing as it might enhance the visual comprehension and
classification of inherent behaviors. Nevertheless, an excessive
conglomeration of signal features might obscure the precise
identification of targeted behaviors. For our study, we incorporated a
total of seven distinct signal features. The criteria for classifying
``lying'' in the first feature are explicit: if the inclination of the
hip accelerometer surpasses 65 degrees and the thigh accelerometer
simultaneously identifies as ``sitting'' based on Skotte et al.'s
activity type classification
algorithm\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-skotte_detection_2014}{46}}.
The other signal features, barring ``time'', are directly procured from
Skotte et al.'s algorithm. These features, delineated in
Table~\ref{tbl-man_signal_features}, concern the longitudinal axis of
the body. Data derived from accelerometry undergoes processing using a
window length of two seconds (60 samples) and has a 50\% overlap (30
samples), ensuring a resolution of one second. The methodologies from
Skotte et al.~and those generating the first feature rely exclusively on
the accelerometer's inclination(s). Hence, while they can determine time
in bed and participant's posture, they aren't precise indicators for
pinpointing exact in-bed and out-of-bed moments.

To provide a visual perspective, Figure~\ref{fig-screen_full} and
Figure~\ref{fig-screen_night} depict the Audacity interface displaying
all seven signal features as cataloged in
Table~\ref{tbl-man_signal_features}. Figure~\ref{fig-screen_full} offers

\subsubsection{Annotation Process Conducted by Expert
Raters}\label{annotation-process-conducted-by-expert-raters}}

Three experienced researchers, well-versed in working with accelerometer
data, were chosen as raters. Their proficiency ensured that they had the
requisite knowledge to accurately interpret the various data channels
presented to them. Each rater meticulously reviewed and labeled each
wav-file, marking specific timestamps that indicated in-bed and
out-of-bed activities. These annotations were then saved as individual
text files. For ensuring consistency and reliability in the annotations,
each wav-file underwent two rounds of labeling. Importantly, at no point
during this process were the raters privy to any prior annotations,
either made by themselves or their colleagues.

\hypertarget{establishing-the-ground-truth-using-zm}{%
\subsubsection{Establishing the Ground Truth Using
ZM}\label{establishing-the-ground-truth-using-zm}}

The definitive ground truth for in-bed and out-of-bed time frames was
gleaned from the sleep staging data derived from the ZM. This was
established by identifying the first and last events at night that did
not present any sensor-related issues. Nights where the ZM detected
sensor problems, either at the onset or conclusion of the recording,
were excluded from further consideration. Such sensor issues typically
arise due to inadequate attachment of electrodes. To maintain accuracy
in data collection, all participants were meticulously instructed to
affix the ZM and activate it precisely at their bedtime and to detach it
upon waking. These crucial timestamps were then utilized as the ground
truth for the study.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Statistical Analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

The statistical interpretations for this study were achieved using the R
statistical software (version 4.0.2, released on 22 June 2020) and its
complementary interface, RStudio (version 1.1.456). For continuous
variables, the descriptive attributes were gauged using medians and
interquartile ranges. Meanwhile, categorical variables were assessed
based on their proportions. To offer a clear distinction, the
characteristics for children and adults were presented separately.

The core of the statistical analysis encompassed agreement studies which
were executed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the
Bland--Altman analysis. Additionally, to provide a comprehensive visual
representation of the agreement and symmetry across methodologies,
probability density distribution plots were integrated. The ICC, as a
metric, goes beyond merely correlating two techniques; it evaluates if
they align in magnitude. The scale for interpretation is as follows:

\(ICC < 0.5\) signifies poor agreement

\(0.5 < ICC > 0.75\) indicates moderate agreement

\(0.75 < ICC > 0.9\) represents good agreement

\(ICC > 0.90\) underscores excellent agreemen

In this research, the ICC values were interpreted based on their 95\%
confidence intervals, adhering to recommended
guidelines\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-koo_guideline_2016}{47}}.
The Bland--Altman analysis, on the other hand, is a tool to measure the
concurrence between two measuring
techniques\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bland_measuring_1999}{48}}.
It calculates the average of the differences (representing bias) between
the two methods, and also establishes the limits of this agreement. A
positive mean difference suggests an earlier underestimation of the
in-bed or out-of-bed timestamp relative to the ZM, while a negative
difference indicates a later overestimation.

Analyses}\label{intraclass-correlation-coefficient-analyses}}

The analyses of Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) underscored an exemplary
consistency when comparing ZM's automatic in-bed annotations with manual
annotations. This was evident in both metrics assessed: time to bed and
time out of bed. The high agreement was consistent across both
evaluation phases---Round 1 and Round 2---and was observed in the
initial baseline as well as the subsequent follow-up assessments.
Reinforcing the robustness of these findings, the lower bounds of the
confidence intervals consistently remained above 0.9, suggesting a high

In our analysis, we also identified a remarkable consistency between the
data from self-reports and the ZM measurements. This high level of
agreement was evident in both the initial baseline data as well as the
subsequent follow-up data. The strength of this agreement is underscored

Our analysis evaluated the agreement among three manual raters in
annotating timestamps for both `to bed' and `out of bed' events. The
Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) from this evaluation
demonstrated strong consensus among the raters. Specifically, the lower
bounds of the 95\% confidence intervals were consistently strong, never
dropping below 0.88, highlighting both good and excellent agreement
levels. However, when analyzing the ICCs more closely, subtle variations
appear between the `to bed' and `out of bed' timestamps. This nuanced
observation is detailed in Table~\ref{tbl-man_icc_man_man}.

The test-retest reliability exhibited good to excellent ICC agreement
for each rater between the first and second rounds, applicable to both
baseline and follow-up data (refer to
Table~\ref{tbl-man_icc_test_retest}). This robust reliability is further
evidenced by the 95\% confidence intervals having lower limits not less
than 0.86. While the ICCs across raters are broadly consistent, there's
a distinction: Raters 1 and 3 had slightly reduced agreement in their
baseline to-bed annotations relative to subsequent ones. In contrast,
Rater 2's ICC scores remained stable and didn't reflect this trend.

\section{Paper II: Generalizability and Performance of Methods to Detect
Non-Wear With Free-Living Accelerometer
Recordings}\label{paper-ii-generalizability-and-performance-of-methods-to-detect-non-wear-with-free-living-accelerometer-recordings}}

This segment of the thesis encompasses the methods, results, and
discussion for Paper II. Wearable sensors, commonly used to track
physical activity, face challenges in detecting ``non-wear'' times.
While traditional methods use fixed interval heuristic algorithms, this
study explored decision trees that use raw acceleration and skin
temperature data. By training on thigh- and hip-worn devices from 64
children and validating with wrist-worn data from 42 adolescents,
results showed traditional methods excel for non-wear durations over 60
minutes. However, for durations below 60 minutes, decision tree models,
especially those with the top six predictors, were superior. The study
emphasizes method selection's significance and promotes external
validation for machine learning models in this area. Some of the details
presented here were previously mentioned in the published version of
Paper
I\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-skovgaard_generalizability_2023}{50}}.

\hypertarget{methods-1}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}}

The classification and generalizability of non-wear classification
methods were evaluated using free-living data collected from
accelerometers positioned on the wrist, thigh, and hip. This data
amalgamated findings from the Physical Activity in Schools After the
Reform
(PHASAR)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-pedersen_protocol_2018}{51}}
study, which provided hip and thigh data, with an in-house validation
study that used wrist-worn accelerometers.
Figure~\ref{fig-paper2_flowchart} illustrates the data utilization
process. By leveraging these datasets, we ensured that established
non-wear classification methods underwent assessment on an external
dataset. Moreover, our decision tree models were tested on an
independent external dataset, including wear locations not initially
considered during model development. Therefore, all machine-learned
models underwent evaluation using test data from various anatomical
positions, regardless of their inclusion in the model's initial
development.

\hypertarget{reference-methods}{%
\subsubsection{Reference Methods}\label{reference-methods}}

To thoroughly evaluate and compare the performance of our three newly
developed algorithms, we incorporated four additional non-wear
classification methods. The selection of these existing methods was
grounded in our aim to span a broad range of methodological flexibility.
We specifically targeted techniques ranging from the most simplistic and
commonly used to the most recent and sophisticated.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textsf{\textbf{Consecutive Zeros-Algorithm (cz\_60):}} Over the
  years, there have been various consecutive zero-algorithms designed
  for accelerometer data, with the aim of identifying non-wear periods
  within stipulated timeframes, such as 30-, 60-, or 90-minute
  intervals\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hecht_methodology_2009}{52}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-choi_validation_2011}{54}}.
  In addition, van Hees and colleagues have developed non-wear
  algorithms for raw acceleration using a 30-minute
  interval\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-van_hees_estimation_2011}{55}}.
  They later expanded this approach to include a 60-minute
  interval\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rasmussen_short-term_2020}{40}}.
  Another method utilizes a 135-minute interval with adjusted
  hyperparameters, as introduced by Syed et
  al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-syed_evaluating_2020}{56}}.
  In our study, we adopted a straightforward approach to this concept.
  Using Actigraphy counts, we identified periods of no movement that
  registered zero counts for at least 60 continuous minutes. Notably,
  these Actigraphy counts operate with a deadband set at 68 mg, which
  denotes the minimum detectable acceleration threshold.
\item
  \textsf{\textbf{Heuristic Algorithm (heu\_alg):}} As detailed by
  Rasmussen and
  colleagues\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rasmussen_short-term_2020}{40}},
  this algorithm merges raw acceleration data with surface skin
  temperature measurements. Non-wear time is determined for periods
  surpassing 120 minutes with accelerations less than 20 mg. For
  durations between 45 to 120 minutes, non-wear is identified if the
  temperature falls below a personalized non-moving temperature
  threshold. Additionally, the algorithm can spot non-wear periods
  ranging from 10 to 45 minutes, but only if these intervals end within
  the anticipated awake hours.
\item
  \textsf{\textbf{Random Forests Model(sunda\_RF):}} Sundararajan et
  al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sundararajan_sleep_2021}{29}}
  delineated a non-wear classification technique grounded in a random
  forest ensemble model. This model was informed by raw accelerometer
  data derived from 134 participants aged between 20 to 70 years. These
  subjects were fitted with an accelerometer on their wrist for a
  singular overnight PSG session. The verifiable labels for non-wear
  periods were anchored in the assumption that the accelerometer was
  donned only during the PSG. Any epoch with a standard deviation in the
  acceleration signal exceeding 13.0 mg outside the PSG was classified
  as wear time. The model utilized 36 predictors, and a nested
  cross-validation method was employed both to ascertain the model's
  generalization capability and to refine its hyperparameters.
\item
  \textsf{\textbf{Deep Convolutional Neural Network (syed\_CNN):}} This
  method, introduced by Syed et
  al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-syed_novel_2021}{57}},
  employs a unique approach. It's built upon a deep convolutional neural
  network (CNN) that diverges from traditional techniques. Initially,
  all potential non-wear episodes are discerned using a standard
  deviation threshold. However, instead of scrutinizing the acceleration
  within these intervals, the focus shifts to the signal shape of the
  raw acceleration immediately before and after a non-wear episode.
  Through the CNN, the method discerns non-wear periods by detecting the
  moments when the accelerometer is removed and reattached. For our
  study's purposes, we chose a window length of 10 seconds on each side
  of the identified non-wear episode, as this yielded the most accurate
  results. The training dataset that informed the CNN consisted of data
  from hip-mounted accelerometers worn by 583 participants. These
  individuals ranged in age from 40 to 84 years, with an average age of
  62.74 and a standard deviation of 10.25.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-collection-and-devices-used}{%
\subsubsection{Data Collection and Devices
Used}\label{data-collection-and-devices-used}}

Both the PHASAR study and the in-house validation research utilized the
Axivity AX3 accelerometer (Axivity Ltd., Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) to
record raw acceleration data along with surface skin temperature. The
device, weighing a mere 11 g and with dimensions of 23 mm √ó 32.5 mm √ó
7.6 mm, measures acceleration in gravity units (g) across three axes
(vertical, mediolateral, and anteroposterior). The sampling frequencies
were set at 50 Hz for the PHASAR study and 25 Hz for the in-house study.
However, all recorded data from both studies were uniformly resampled to
30 Hz.

\hypertarget{description-of-the-studies}{%
\subsubsection{Description of the
Studies}\label{description-of-the-studies}}

\emph{PHASAR Study:} The PHASAR study involved a representative sample
of over 2000 school-aged children from 31 public schools in Denmark. The
study, conducted between 2017 and 2018, captured data from 1,315 boys
(49\%) and 1,358 girls (51\%), aged between 8.1 to 17.9 years (mean age
= 12.14, SD = 2.40). Accelerometers were placed at two specific
anatomical sites: the right hip and midway on the right thigh. They were
worn for a recommended seven consecutive days to reliably estimate
habitual physical activity. For this analysis, data from 64 randomly
selected participants from the PHASAR cohort were used. A dataset
indicating genuine non-wear time was created via manual annotation, a
method elaborated in another publication. Essentially, non-wear periods
were determined by visually examining raw accelerations coupled with
skin temperature readings. True non-wear episodes with specific start
and end times were manually labelled in each dataset and were utilized
as reference labels in subsequent analyses.

\emph{In-House Validation Study:} This study consisted of accelerometer
data from 42 youth athletes, evenly split between boys and girls, aged
14.5 to 16.4 years (mean age = 15.4, SD = 0.37 years). These athletes,
part of a specialized talent program in the Region of Southern Denmark,
wore the Axivity accelerometer on their non-dominant wrist for 14
consecutive days. This study was initiated in the spring of 2021. A
dataset mirroring the one from the PHASAR study was created, including
all 42 participants.

\hypertarget{ethical-considerations}{%
\subsubsection{Ethical Considerations}\label{ethical-considerations}}

The PHASAR study was reviewed by the Regional Committee on Health
Research Ethics for Southern Denmark (ID: S-20170031) and was determined
not to require an ethics review, as per Danish regulations, which
mandate only biomedical research or risk-involved studies to undergo a
formal ethics review. Documentation regarding this decision is available
upon request from the principal author. Conversely, the in-house
validation study received an ethical approval waiver from the Research
\& Innovation Organization and the legal department of the University of
Southern Denmark. All participants, or their legal guardians, provided
written informed consent for both studies, which adhered to the Danish
Data Protection Agency (2015-57-0008) standards and globally recognized
guidelines like the Declaration of Helsinki.

devices.}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{development-of-decision-tree-models}{%
\subsubsection{Development of Decision Tree
Models:}\label{development-of-decision-tree-models}}

For our decision tree models, we sourced 12 predictors from the raw
PHASAR accelerometer data, which encompassed elements like temperature,
time of day, indicators for device placement, day of the week, and
moving average statistics (detailed in Table~\ref{tbl-8}). These moving
average metrics were collated in 10-second increments. To train the
model, we utilized 79.2\% of the PHASAR data, incorporating data from
both hip- and thigh-worn devices (as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-paper2_flowchart}). A critical aspect of our methodology
was the data partitioning: we made certain that data from individual
participants was exclusively allocated to either the training or test
datasets. This strategy was crucial in ensuring that the model could
effectively generalize to unfamiliar data, rather than overfitting to
specific participant data. During the tuning phase, to boost model
accuracy and avoid overfitting, we opted for a five-fold
cross-validation approach. This process entailed refining several
hyperparameters, such as the tree's depth, its cost-complexity, and the
minimum amount of data points necessary in a node for it to split
further. To effectively explore the hyperparameter space, we employed
Latin hypercube sampling. This method systematically divides the
parameter range into segments, randomly drawing a value from each
segment, resulting in a well-distributed set of parameter combinations.
In our case, we established a 10-level parameter grid, guaranteeing a
comprehensive exploration of the hyperparameter space.

Following this procedure, we introduced three distinct model variations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A full-scope model (\emph{tree\_full}) incorporating every predictor.
\item
  A refined model (\emph{tree\_imp6}) centered on the six most crucial
  predictors, as established by permutation predictor importance
  (Figure~\ref{fig-importance}).
\item
  A model excluding surface skin temperature data
  (\emph{tree\_no\_temp}).
\end{enumerate}

In sum, our methodology generated 50 distinct models for each decision
tree variant. Given our data's distribution - 55.8\% wear time compared
to 44.2\% non-wear time - there was no need to adopt synthetic minority
oversampling methods like SMOTE or other balancing techniques.

\hypertarget{statistics}{%
\subsubsection{Statistics}\label{statistics}}

We assessed the classification performance to each ground truth test
dataset, which combined consisted of over 7 million 10-second epochs
from 104 distinct subjects. True positives (TP) represent correctly
identified non-wear time, and true negatives (TN) denote correctly
identified wear time. Both TPs and TNs are vital for the algorithm's
accuracy. These correct classifications are vital for the high accuracy
of our non-wear time algorithm. Misclassifications, where non-wear time
is labeled as wear and vice-versa, resulted in False Negatives (FN) and
False Positives (FP). To determine these classifications, we analyzed
the acceleration data in 10-second intervals, comparing inferred results
with ground truth labels. This comparison allowed us to construct a
confusion matrix. We then computed the overall accuracy, sensitivity,
precision, and F1-score to evaluate the effectiveness of each non-wear
detection method. Notably, a high F1-score, which is the harmonic mean
of precision and sensitivity, indicates superior classification
performance. We further delved into the permutation predictor importance
to discern the factors behind the enhanced performance of our decision
tree models. All our analyses and model developments were conducted
using R (version 4.1.2, Bird Hippie) and RStudio (version 2021.9.1.372,
Ghost Orchid), with Tidymodels for machine learning and the rpart
package serving as the decision tree algorithm engine.

\[accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}\]
\[sensitivity = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}\] \[precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}\]
\[F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{precision \cdot sensitivity}{precision + sensitivity}\]

The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity,
provides an indicator of the classification performance. A high F1-score
suggests commendable classification prowess.

Additionally, we delved into the permutation predictor importance to
discern what factors contributed to the superior performance of certain
decision tree models.

For all analytical processes and model development, we utilized R
(version 4.1.2, Bird Hippie) and RStudio (version 2021.9.1.372, Ghost
Orchid). The machine learning tasks were primarily facilitated by the
Tidymodels\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kuhn2020}{\textbf{kuhn2020?}}}
suite of packages, and we used the
rpart\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rpart}{58}} package as the
engine for our decision tree algorithms.

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-1}}

In our gold standard datasets spanning three wear locations, there were
1,598 non-wear time episodes. Of these, 1,148 episodes (or 71.8\%)
lasted 60 minutes or more, with an average duration of about 13 hours
(794 minutes with a standard deviation of 1,142 minutes). In contrast,
episodes lasting 60 minutes or less made up 28.2\% (450 episodes) with
an average duration of 26.4 minutes (SD = 16.4). Interestingly, the
briefest episodes (less than 60 minutes) made up just 1.3\% of the total
non-wear time across all wear locations (refer to Table~\ref{tbl-9}).
Figure~\ref{fig-paper2_nw_dists} depicts the frequency distribution for
episodes shorter than 60 minutes and those 60 minutes or longer. The
PHASAR dataset showed a bimodal distribution for shorter episodes, with
longer episodes peaking around 10 hours. For the in-house wrist-worn
dataset, shorter episodes displayed a uniform distribution, while longer
episodes were significantly right-skewed.

\hypertarget{classification-performance}{%
\subsubsection{Classification
Performance}\label{classification-performance}}

In assessing classification performance,
Figure~\ref{fig-paper2_preds_ex} visually contrasts the results from
machine-learned models and rule-based algorithms against the ground
truth non-wear time, which is highlighted with a light blue background.
This visualization underscores that while tree-based models tend to be
precise, they can also be unpredictable. On the other hand,
threshold-based methods, such as Syed\_CNN, heu\_alg, and cz\_60, offer
more consistency. Notably, both cz\_60 and heu\_alg algorithms fall
short in identifying shorter non-wear episodes.

Detailing further, Figure~\ref{fig-paper2_performance_all} compiles
performance metrics from all methods evaluated in this study. The CNN
model by Syed et al.~demonstrated consistency across three datasets,
achieving an overall accuracy between 75\% and 80\%. It stood out with a
sensitivity score between 93\% and 96\%. However, its F1 scores, which
hovered between 82\% and 84\%, were hampered by only average precision.
Conversely, the random forests model by Sundararajan et al.~shone with
wrist data, boasting an F1 score of 94\% and accuracy of 93\%. Still,
its performance dwindled with hip and thigh data, marking an overall
accuracy of 56\% and precision of 59\%. This drop suggests a significant
number of false positives.

Among the decision tree models, the variant excluding surface skin
temperature as a predictor fared the poorest for wrist data, achieving a
mere 72\% accuracy. While it secured a high sensitivity score of 98\%,
its subpar precision dragged its F1 score down to 81\%. The other two
decision tree models---one incorporating the six most critical
predictors and the other using all predictors---consistently performed
well across metrics and datasets. Remarkably, both the heu\_alg and
cz\_60 algorithms approached perfection across evaluations.

Further, Figure~\ref{fig-paper2_performance_short} zeroes in on
performance metrics for episodes 60 minutes or shorter. The consecutive
zeros algorithm was unable to detect any non-wear, a result absent from
the figure. Syed et al.'s deep learning model underperformed, detecting
a mere 1--2\% of all non-wear time, leading to F1 scores below 5\%.
Although the heu\_alg algorithm boasted high precision, its lackluster
sensitivity resulted in F1 scores spanning from 12\% to 16\% across wear
locations. The random forest model displayed average results for thigh
and wrist data but faltered with hip data, recording F1 scores of 46\%,
57\%, and 8\%, respectively. Among the trio of decision tree models, the
one leveraging the six pivotal predictors outshone the rest, with F1
scores between 72\% and 79\%. Meanwhile, the decision tree model
encompassing all predictors faced challenges with hip data due to a 23\%
sensitivity score. Excluding the surface skin temperature, another
decision tree model exhibited commendable precision; however, its low
sensitivity culminated in F1 scores ranging from 45\% to 57\%.

This segment of the thesis encompasses the methods, results, and
discussion for Paper III. Polysomnography, the premier method for sleep
evaluation, is not always feasible for extensive research due to its
high costs and impracticality. Wearable accelerometers present an
affordable solution. While wrist and hip-worn devices dominate sleep
studies, the potential of thigh-worn accelerometers remains largely
untapped. This paper delves into the use of machine learning and deep
learning models that leverage data from thigh-worn accelerometers to
gauge sleep and its quality. By comparing these models with an EEG-based
sleep monitor and utilizing data from 585 days and nights of children
aged 4-17 years, we discerned that the XGBoost model, particularly when
applied to 5-minute median filtered data, showcased the most promise.
This model demonstrated minimal biases and a robust correlation with
total sleep time, highlighting its applicability. Nevertheless, our
findings also exposed certain limitations, especially in determining
awake intervals during in-bed periods. Thus, while our results are
encouraging for group-level sleep quality estimation using machine
learning, further refinement is essential for precise individual
assessments due to observed limits of agreement in thigh-worn
accelerometry data.

\hypertarget{dataset-and-participants}{%
\subsubsection{Dataset and
Participants}\label{dataset-and-participants}}

The current study uses data from the SCREENS trial, which took place
from June 2019 to March 2021 in the Region of Southern Denmark.
Conducted by Rasmussen and
Pedersen\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rasmussen_short-term_2020}{40},\protect\hyperlink{ref-pedersen_effects_2022}{59}},
the trial aimed to evaluate the impact of limiting screen media usage
among Danish families. We specifically analyzed data from children
between the ages of 4 and 17, with a mean age of 9.1 years, who were
part of the SCREENS cohort. To gather our primary data, we utilized
accelerometer readings from Axivity AX3 devices attached to the
children's thighs and sleep metrics derived from EEG readings using the
ZM device by General Sleep Corporation.

The Axivity AX3 is a 3-axis accelerometer positioned midway between the
hip and knee on the right anterior thigh. This device records movement
data, and it is unobtrusive, allowing for natural behavior from the
children. On the other hand, the ZM device uses advanced EEG hardware
and signal processing algorithms to gather sleep data. It features three
self-adhesive, disposable sensors placed outside the hairline, ensuring
reliable EEG signal acquisition. Participants were instructed to attach
the device at bedtime and remove it upon leaving bed. To process the
sleep data, the ZM device uses two proprietary algorithms, Z-ALG and
Z-PLUS. The former is known for its accurate sleep detection
capabilities, which make it suitable for in-home monitoring as supported
by Kaplan et
al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kaplan_performance_2014}{44}},
while the latter differentiates between sleep stages and aligns well
with expert evaluations using PSG data, as demonstrated by Wang et
al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wang_evaluation_2015}{43}}.

In this study, we didn't focus on different sleep stages like light
sleep (N1 \& N2), deep sleep (N3), and REM sleep; instead, we
categorized the output of the ZM into ``awake'' and ``asleep.'' This
simplification was made to streamline the data for the machine learning
algorithms and because distinguishing between sleep stages was not
crucial for the sleep quality metrics of interest. As illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-paper3_flow}, we only considered recordings that had
complete accelerometer data from the Axivity AX3 and ZM readings lasting
between 7 and 14 hours. Recordings with sensor issues reported by the ZM
were excluded. As a result, our study included a total of 585 nights
from 151 children, with an average of 3.87 nights per child (SD = 1.86).
The mean age of these children was 9.4 years, with a standard deviation
of 2.1. Our study encompassed 696,779 epochs, each lasting 30 seconds,
and about 84\% of the ZM recordings were classified as sleep.

Lastly, the study adhered to ethical guidelines, receiving approval from
the Regional Scientific Committee of Southern Denmark. All data handling
processes were in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), ensuring the secure and ethical management of participant
information.

\subsubsection{Data preprocessing and Feature
Extraction}\label{data-preprocessing-and-feature-extraction}}

In this study, we began by processing raw accelerometer data through a
low-pass filtration step, utilizing a 4th order Butterworth filter with
a 5 Hz cut-off frequency to remove high-frequency noise as described by
Skotte and
colleagues\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-skotte_detection_2014}{46}}.
Non-wear data was identified and eliminated using the methods outlined
in Paper
2\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-skovgaard_generalizability_2023}{50}},
and the remaining data was resampled into 30-second epochs to align with
ZM recordings.

We then conducted feature extraction, generating 64 features that
offered a comprehensive characterization of the data. These features
were derived from both accelerometer and temperature signals and
included temporal elements, which utilized both lag and lead values to
capture dynamic data trends. Additionally, we took inspiration from
Walch et
al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-walch_sleep_2019}{60}} to
include sensor-independent features that encapsulate circadian rhythms,
offering unique insights that are not directly discernible from sensor
outputs (see Figure~\ref{fig-paper3_sensor_independent}). We further
enriched the feature set by incorporating signal characteristics such as
vector magnitude, mean crossing rate, skewness, and kurtosis for each of
the x, y, and z dimensions.

The ZM recordings and the corresponding accelerometer data were then
merged. Any time overlap between these two sets of data was categorized
as `in-bed' time, while the remaining time was considered `out-of-bed.'
This process yielded a comprehensive dataset that provided a 24-hour
view of each participant's activity and sleep patterns.

We also chose to integrate median-filtered raw predictions from the ZM
device into our modeling process. This decision was based on existing
knowledge that children typically experience between five to eight sleep
cycles per night, with awakenings most likely to occur at the end of
each cycle, as indicated by Galland et al.~However, upon examining the
raw ZM predictions, we noticed an overestimation in the number of
awakenings among the children in our study, surpassing typical sleep
cycle patterns (refer to Figure~\ref{fig-paper3_raw_filt}).
Additionally, the ZM device's average sleep efficiency rating for our
sample was 83\%, falling short of the recognized standards of 85\% as
good efficiency and over 90\% as ideal---a finding that contradicted
prior research on similar child cohorts.

This suggested that the raw ZM predictions might be including a lot of
noise by overestimating awake periods, potentially affecting the
performance of machine learning algorithms by obscuring underlying
patterns. As a result, we decided to train and evaluate our models using
not only the raw ZM output but also versions that underwent 5-minute and
10-minute median filtering. This method effectively reduced the noise
and provided a more age-appropriate count of awakenings, offering, to
the best of our knowledge, a more accurate representation of children's
sleep patterns (see Table~\ref{tbl-10}).

\subsubsection{Algorithms}\label{algorithms}}

In our study to assess sleep patterns, we utilized thigh-mounted
accelerometer data and employed two distinct modeling strategies. The
first approach involved a sequential strategy using a series of binary
classifiers, aiming to simplify the task by breaking down the multiclass
problem into more manageable parts. Initially, we predicted `in-bed'
times, which were then subjected to a 5-minute median filter to
eliminate transient blips. This allowed us to identify a single
continuous time interval, termed the Sleep Period Time (SPT), which
represents the total time spent in bed attempting to sleep. The SPT
served as the input for a second set of binary classifiers focused on
predicting `sleep' time, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.

Four machine learning algorithms were applied in this sequential
strategy. Logistic regression acted as a fast and straightforward
baseline model, although its linear nature limited its ability to
capture complex, non-linear patterns. Decision trees, capable of
handling non-linear patterns, were implemented with a maximum tree depth
of 8 to mitigate overfitting and maintain easy interpretability.
Single-layer feed-forward neural networks, while challenging to
interpret, were effective in capturing non-linear relationships. Careful
tuning was required to avoid overfitting. Lastly, XGBoost was used for
its high accuracy and built-in overfitting prevention techniques,
despite its computational intensity and interpretational challenges.

Simultaneously, we also explored a second modeling strategy using a
multiclass algorithm based on a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
(biLSTM) neural
network\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hochreiter_long_1997}{61}}.
This model was designed to predict three distinct sleep states:
`out-of-bed-awake,' `in-bed-awake,' and `in-bed-asleep.' It featured
four layers and 128 hidden units per layer, balancing model complexity
and training efficiency. The bidirectional architecture doubled the
hidden units at each time step, enhancing data interpretation and
reducing the risk of overfitting. The model accepted sequences of
tensors spanning 10 minutes with a step size of one epoch. This approach
is supported by previous research such as studies by Sano et
al.~(2019)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sano_multimodal_2019}{62}}{]}
and Chen et
al.~(2021)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-chen_attention_2021}{63}}{]},
which have demonstrated the efficacy of LSTM models in sleep detection
by capturing complex temporal patterns in accelerometer data.

\hypertarget{model-training}{%
\subsubsection{Model Training}\label{model-training}}

We trained a total of four pairs of models sequentially to distinguish
between two sets of states: in-bed/out-of-bed and asleep/awake. The
dataset was randomly split into a training and a testing set, each
containing approximately half of the subjects. To ensure the robustness
of the results, we made sure that data from the same night was not
distributed across both sets. To optimize our models, we used a specific
set of hyperparameters for each type of machine learning algorithm. For
the Decision Tree, we tuned the cost complexity, tree depth, and minimum
number of samples required at a leaf node. The decision tree model was
set up using the
\texttt{rpart}\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rpart}{58}} engine
for classification, with tree depth ranging from 3 to 7. For Logistic
Regression, implemented using the
\texttt{glmnet}\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-friedman_glmnet_2010}{64}}
engine, we considered tuning the penalty and mixture parameters. The
feed-forward neural network was implemented with a single-layer
feed-forward architecture using the
\texttt{nnet}\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-nnet}{65}} engine,
with the maximum number of allowable weights set to 7000 as a form of
regularization. The hyperparameters we tuned for this model were the
number of hidden units, the penalty, and the number of epochs. The range
for the number of hidden units was between 3 and 27. Lastly, the XGBoost
model was configured with the
\texttt{xgboost}\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-xgboost}{66}}
engine. The hyperparameters subjected to tuning included tree depth,
learning rate, loss reduction, minimum number of samples required at a
leaf node, sample size, and number of trees. For this algorithm, the
number of trees was specifically tuned within a range of 200 to 800.
These hyperparameters were optimized using a 10-fold Monte Carlo
cross-validation, carried out on a regular grid comprising different
combinations of these parameters. By providing the range and the
specific hyperparameters considered for each model, we ensured the most
robust and optimal model fitting.

After identifying the best-performing hyperparameters, we proceeded to
fit the models to the full training dataset. This approach made it
possible to use all available data for model parameter estimation, thus
maximizing performance. However, an imbalance issue was noted after the
initial step of our sequential model strategy. This imbalance in the
resulting dataset - the awake in-bed class was underrepresented, making
up only about 15\% of the training data - could induce biases during
model training, as models tend to favor the majority class. To correct
this, we employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
as outlined by Chawla et
al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-chawla_smote_2002}{67}}.
Using the themis R
package\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-themis}{68}}, we
implemented SMOTE to achieve a balanced distribution of training samples
across both classes. The F1 score served as the optimization metric
because it balances both precision and recall, and therefore is more
robust to class imbalance.

In parallel to these sequential models, we also trained a bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (biLSTM) model to classify three distinct states:
out-of-bed-awake, in-bed-awake, and in-bed-asleep. The data for this
model was divided into training, validation, and test sets, adhering to
a 50/25/25 split ratio. Again, caution was exercised to avoid having
data from the same night across different sets. For efficient and
adaptive learning, the Adam optimizer was used during the training
process. Given that we were dealing with a multiclass classification
task with mutually exclusive classes, the cross-entropy loss function
was employed. At the output layer, a softmax activation function was
applied to obtain a probability distribution over the classes. We
monitored the model's performance using the F1 score for both the
training and validation sets and employed early stopping with a patience
of 3 epochs, ceasing training if no improvement in the validation loss
was observed over three consecutive epochs.

\hypertarget{model-validation}{%
\subsection{Model Validation}\label{model-validation}}

In our study, we utilized standard evaluation metrics to assess the
performance of each model on an epoch-to-epoch basis. These include
\[accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}\]
\[sensitivity = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}\] \[specificity = \frac{TN}{TN+FP}\]
\[precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}\] \[NPV = \frac{TN}{TN + FN}\]
\[F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{precision \cdot sensitivity}{precision + sensitivity}\]

where \(NPV\) is negative predictive value, \(F_1\) is the F1 score,
\(TP\) is true positives, \(FP\) is false positives, \(TN\) is true
negatives, and \(FN\) is false negatives.

In our sequential model strategy, we initially focused on models that
carried out binary classification tasks distinguishing between in-bed
and out-of-bed states. We gauged these models' performance through
various metrics, including the F1-score, accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, and precision. Subsequently, we shifted our focus to models
that could identify the binary state of being asleep or awake, using the
same metrics as well as the negative predictive rate. Due to the class
imbalance, we calculated the F1 score as an unweighted macro-average. We
also scrutinized a multiclass biLSTM classifier using the same metrics,
interpreting its multiclass output as two separate binary
classifications: out-of-bed versus all other states, and in-bed-awake
versus in-bed-asleep. To give a comprehensive view of model performance,
we offered confusion matrices for the entire dataset, covering both
in-bed and out-of-bed data. These matrices report relative counts,
column percentages for accurate predictions of the true class, and row
percentages for correctly classified predictions. Both in-bed/out-of-bed
and awake/asleep classification tasks were treated as binary,
designating `in-bed' and `asleep' as positive labels and `out-of-bed'
and `awake' as negative labels, in line with prior
studies\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hjorth_measure_2012}{69},\protect\hyperlink{ref-kushida_comparison_2001}{70}}.

To evaluate how well our models performed in generating sleep quality
metrics, we employed Bland-Altman plots and Pearson correlations.
Specifically, the Bland-Altman approach was used to gauge the level of
agreement between two different measurement techniques. Since our
dataset included multiple but uneven observations per subject, we used a
bootstrap procedure to account for extra variability. We initially
calculated the mean difference or bias, and then determined the limits
of agreement (LOA) as the bias ¬± 1.96 times the standard deviation of
these differences. Given the possibility of non-normal distribution and
skewness in our data, we opted for a bias-corrected and accelerated
(BCa) bootstrap method {[}@diciccio\_bootstrap\_1996{]}. This allowed
for more accurate estimation, taking into account intra-subject
variability. Using 10,000 bootstrap replicates, we confirmed 95\%
confidence intervals for both the bias and LOA, thereby ensuring robust
measurements. Our sleep quality metrics conformed to ZM definitions and
included the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sleep Period Time (SPT) - This refers to the total duration of time in
  bed with the intention to sleep, which is defined as the time from the
  start to the end of the ZM recording.
\item
  Total Sleep Time (TST) - This is the time spent asleep within the SPT.
\item
  Sleep Efficiency (SE) - This is the ratio between TST and SPT,
  representing the proportion of the sleep period that was actually
  spent asleep.
\item
  Latency Until Persistent Sleep (LPS) - This metric represents the time
  it takes to transition from wakefulness to sustained sleep. It is
  calculated as the time from the beginning of the ZM recording until
  the first period when 10 out of 12 minutes are scored as sleep.
\item
  Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO) - This refers to the time spent awake
  after initially falling asleep and before the final awakening. In our
  analysis, a period is counted as `awake' only if it consists of 3 or
  more contiguous 30-second epochs which is also how the ZM summarizes
  WASO.
