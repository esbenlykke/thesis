# Preface

The journey of my PhD has been a fulfilling expedition, layered with explorations, discoveries, struggles, and growth. This endeavor was fueled by my interest in understanding the objective measurements of physical behavior and sleep. During my Masters, I found myself increasingly engrossed in these domains.

My subsequent role as a research assistant at Aarhus University opened another dimension of learning for me. The works of my peers, employing machine learning and advanced statistics on accelerometer data, intrigued me. It was as if I found the nexus of my research interests, a perfect alignment that seamlessly fused my curiosities and passions.

One of the most significant hurdles was my limited experience with programming and machine learning, which proved to be a steep learning curve. However, through persistence, I slowly developed the necessary skills to analyze and interpret my data effectively. Another major setback was the failed data collection for my third paper. I spent months visiting families, mounting an ambulatory PSG device on children before bedtime, and facing the harsh reality of dealing with poor data quality.

This thesis brings together my explorations and findings across three papers that carry a consistent emphasis on improving and validating methods to leverage accelerometer data for studying human behaviors. The common thread across these papers is the application of innovative methods, particularly machine learning techniques, to enhance the utility, reliability, and accuracy of free-living accelerometer data for monitoring human sleep and physical activity. The work presented here constitutes a substantial contribution to the field of sleep and physical activity research, particularly in the context of large-scale studies.

Two of these papers have already found their place in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and the third is under review. All of these works are included as appendices to this thesis, and their content has been weaved into the fabric of this thesis.

As I look back at my journey through the PhD program, I am grateful for this opportunity to delve deep into a subject that I am passionate about and to contribute to a field that is evolving rapidly. This experience has instilled in me a sense of tenacity and patience, qualities that I have come to value deeply. I learned that even the most frustrating problems have solutions, and the path to those solutions often leads to personal growth and novel insights.

As I stand on the precipice of my future, I am filled with a sense of anticipation and excitement for the possibilities that lie ahead. I am eager to explore new horizons, to encounter new challenges, and to continue growing as a researcher and as an individual. However, wherever I go and whatever I do, I will carry with me the memories, experiences, and lessons from this incredible journey.

These years have shaped me in ways I could never have imagined at the outset, and for that, I am profoundly grateful. As I close this chapter of my life, I do so with a sense of accomplishment and a promise of continued exploration and discovery in my field. After all, every ending is but a new beginning, and I look forward to the adventures that await.

Over the past decade, an expanding body of literature has underscored the vital role of physical activity and sleep in sustaining overall human health. These key components of our daily routine are not merely elements of lifestyle; they are closely interwoven with our mental and physical well-being, and disturbances in these areas can precipitate a cascade of health issues. Our understanding of the dynamics of physical activity and sleep and their implications on health, however, are contingent upon the accuracy and precision of the methods we employ to measure them. This raises a need for efficient, cost-effective, and minimally invasive tools for longitudinal physical activity and sleep monitoring.

In this context, body-worn motion sensors, specifically accelerometers, have emerged as a significant advancement, providing valuable insights into human physical activity and sleep patterns. Utilizing accelerometers to measure and classify the intensity of human movement and non-wear time has been an integral part of my research during my Ph.D. These devices offer high cost efficiency and minimal participant burden, making them an ideal choice for large-scale studies. However, the challenge lies in effectively interpreting the data generated by these devices, particularly when it comes to accurately distinguishing between wear and non-wear time.

Addressing this challenge has involved utilizing sophisticated machine learning techniques to classify non-wear time in raw accelerometer data, and my studies have extended to investigate the generalizability and performance of these models on unseen data. As part of this effort, we examined the potential benefits and limitations of machine learning in detecting patterns from training data and approximating complex models, taking care to balance model variance and bias. These findings underscore the vital role of these technologies in enhancing the accuracy and precision of non-wear time classification, and underscore the importance of maintaining a balance between overfitting and underfitting.

Further extending the utility of accelerometers, my research delved into the domain of sleep science. Here, we utilized accelerometers as a convenient and affordable means of tracking sleep patterns over extended periods. Recognizing that sleep analysis has been dominated by wrist and hip-worn accelerometers, our focus shifted to the less-explored, but promising, realm of thigh-worn accelerometers for sleep assessment. While there has been progress in estimating sleep duration using these devices, the application of machine learning techniques in this area remains underdeveloped, a gap that our research aimed to address.

We explored a range of machine learning and deep learning models, utilizing raw data collected from a tri-axial thigh-worn accelerometer to estimate in-bed and sleep time. We validated our models against an electroencephalography-based (EEG) sleep tracking device, which served as the gold standard for measuring sleep. Moreover, we evaluated the models' performance in assessing crucial sleep quality metrics, reinforcing the potential of accelerometers as a tool for comprehensive sleep and physical activity tracking.

Taken together, this body of work sheds light on the immense potential of wearable technology, particularly accelerometers, in revolutionizing the field of human physical activity and sleep research. While significant strides have been made in the development and validation of advanced machine learning models to interpret accelerometer data, the journey towards more accurate, user-friendly, and holistic methods of tracking human physical activity and sleep continues. As I continue to navigate this fascinating field, my research aims to bridge the gaps in our understanding and contribute to a future where personalized health monitoring is both accessible and precise.
