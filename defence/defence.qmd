## Why Do We Care About Sleep?

![](img/sleep_health_effects.png)

::: footer
Feingold et al. 2022
:::

::: notes
Sufficient sleep is important in maintaining overall health. <br> Yet insufficient sleep has become a widespread issue, heightening the risk of many serious illnesses. <br> Good sleep not only benefits physical health but also mental well-being and life quality. It's crucial for healthcare providers to educate patients about sleep health and promote lifestyle changes to enhance it.
:::

## How Is "Good Sleep" Defined?

<br> Good sleep is both the **amount** of sleep and the **quality** of your sleep

:::

::: notes
In simple terms, good sleep is both the amount of sleep you get in a night and the quality of your sleep. <br> Most commonly determined by self-report questionnaires or sleep logs. <br> Gold standard PSG. <br> But we can also evaluate sleep using accelerometers. Wrist-accelerometry being the most common wear-location.

Polysomnography (PSG):

Gold-standard technique in sleep research.<br> Combines EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, respiratory and pulse oximetry measurements.<br> Captures comprehensive sleep data in a clinical setting.<br> Useful for diagnosing sleep disorders but costly, requires specialized personnel, and may not reflect free-living sleep conditions. <br> In summary, PSG is not feasible in large-scale studies <br> Note: rater bias -\> objectivity?

**Accelerometry**

::: notes
Emergence of single-channel EEG-based sleep staging algorithms.

Zmachine® Insight+ (ZM): Gaining recognition in sleep studies. Validated against PSG, offering comparable data quality. Cost-effective and requires less specialized oversight. User-friendly for multi-night, real-world evaluations. Ideal for machine learning analyses due to consistent multi-night data. Despite advantages, still has considerable costs and participant demands.

Another low-burden alternative is accelerometry.

Heuristic algorithms to score sleep.

Increasing data availability makes the use of ML more advantages.

-   van Hees algorithm (raw) [@hees_novel_2015]

-   Random Forests in GGIR (raw) [@sundararajan_sleep_2021]

::: notes
Accelerometry as an Alternative to EEG:

Used to overcome limitations of EEG systems and self-reported sleep assessments.

Algorithm Development in Actigraphy:

Evolution from activity count-based to raw acceleration data algorithms. Notable algorithms: ESS (Estimation of Stationary Sleep-segments), algorithm based on accelerometer orientation angle. Shift towards machine learning approaches for enhanced data utilization.

ML have shown superior performance.

Lots of data is necessary to effectively develop robust ML models.

:::

- Sleep detection as a supervised learning task
- Learn/train a model using the training data
- Test the model on unseen data
- Assess model performance

::: {.notes}
The goal is to construct a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven decisions rather than following strictly static instructions (heuristic algorithms)

Learning (training): learn model using training data

Testing: test model using unseen data to assess model performance

## Advantages of Manually Labelling Training Data

![](img/label.png){.absolute top=120 left=-70 width=20%} 

<br>

::: {.absolute top=120 left=150}

- Labelled data sourced from PSG or sleep diaries/sleep logs
- Many studies have exclusively collected accelerometer data
- Potential of manual annotations to fill gaps in data
- No participant burden
- Multiple nights for intra-individual variability
- Free-living conditions

## How To Handle Non-Wear time

<br> 

![](img/incomplete.png){.absolute top=70 left=0 width=10%} 

::: {.absolute top=100 left=130}
Non-wear time is to be considered as missing data
:::

<br>
<br>

- Handling non-wear time is essential for human behavior analyses
- Accurate differentiation between non-wear and sleep is crucial
- Methods include participant log diaries and heuristic algorithms
- Including skin temperature has potential
- As with sleep, more recent methods to detect non-wear use ML

![](img/exclamation.png){.absolute top=520 left=0 width=5%} 

::: {.absolute top=520 left=60}
**Ongoing search for methods to classify non-wear time**

::: {.notes}
Besides accurate labels, the training data must not contain missing data

Essential for accurate human motion and behavior analysis.

Accurate differentiation between non-wear periods and sleep is crucial

heuristic algorithms typically rely on consecutive zero counts

Also, some evidence suggest that incorporating surface skin temperature can enhance accuracy

ML methods include random forests and convolutional neural networks

Ongoing search for an optimal method to classify non-wear time in diverse settings

Conley et al. 2019, Brønd et al. 2020

Most methods focus on data from wrist- and hip-worn devices.

No ML methods to detect sleep used on thigh data

despite the advantages of this sensor location to classify physical activity behaviors

## Thesis Aims and Objectives {.center-text}

<br>

> The overall aim was to develop methods and models for the analysis and interpretation of sleep in accelerometer data

:::: columns
::: {.column width=33% .center-text .smaller-font}
**Paper 1**

Introduce a method for manually annotating in-bed time in raw accelerometry data, validate these annotations against the Zmachine and sleep diaries, and evaluate the consistency of these manual annotations
:::
::: {.column width=33% .center-text .smaller-font}
**Paper 2**

Assess decision tree models for detecting non-wear time in data from thigh and hip-worn accelerometers, including skin temperature, and compare machine-learned models with heuristic algorithms for hip, thigh, and wrist-worn devices.
:::
::: {.column width=33% .center-text .smaller-font}
**Paper 3**

Assess the performance of different ML models in estimating in-bed and sleep time and evaluate precision of derived sleep quality metrics, benchmarking all included methods against sleep recordings of the ZM.
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
The overall aim wass bla blabla through these three paper/manuscripts

Paper 1: The objectives of paper I is to present a method for manually annotating individual
bedtime and wake-up times using raw accelerometry data. Furthermore, to validate
the accuracy of these annotations by comparing them with in-bed and out-of-bed
timestamps as determined by the ZM and by a prospective sleep diary, and lastly,
to assess both inter-rater and intra-rater agreement of the manual annotations.

I like to think of these three papers as enrichment of data, ensure integrity of data, utilization of the data with the combined aim to detect sleep

## Annotation Software and Features

```{r}
tbl_signal_features %>%
  my_gt_theme()
```

![](img/audacity.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
We derived the following signal features from the raw acceleration signal...

Criteria for "lying" based on hip accelerometer inclination (>65 degrees) and thigh accelerometer's "sitting" status.

Most features, except for "time", derived directly from Skotte et al.’s activity type classification algorithm.

Audacity, a open-source audio-editing tool (sorry for the poor-quality screenshot)

Application in Accelerometer Data Analysis:

Useful for detailed inspection of high-resolution raw accelerometer data.

Enables zooming in on specific segments and broad overview of longer data spans.

Annotation process:

Three raters independently reviewed and labeled each wav-file for in-bed and out-of-bed actvities

Annotations saved as individual text files.

Each file labeled twice by each rater for reliability

Raters unaware of prior annotations to avoid biases and maintain objectivity.
