# Knowledge Dissemination Activities

## PhD Publications

The following papers has been published in Sensors[@skovgaard_manual_2021] and Scientific Reports[@skovgaard_generalizability_2023]. \bigskip

::: {#refs}
:::

The results of my research has been presented to our research group on a timely basis, on seminars and to students on some of my courses.

I have had no collaborations with other research environments during my PhD. I have only had discussions with researchers from within my field.
