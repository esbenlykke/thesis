	abstract = {Objective: Current polysomnography-validated measures of sleep status from wrist-worn accelerometers cannot be used in fully automated analysis as they rely on self-reported sleep-onset and -end (sleep-boundary) information. We set out to develop an automated, data-driven approach to sleep-boundary detection from wrist-worn accelerometer data. Methods: On three separate occasions, participants were asked to wear a {GENEActiv} wrist-worn accelerometer for nine days and concurrently complete sleep diaries with lights-off, asleep and wake-up information. We developed and evaluated three data-driven methods for sleep-boundary detection: a change-point detection based method, a thresholding method and a random forest classifier based method. Mean absolute errors between automatically-derived and self-reported sleep-onset and wake-up times were recorded in addition to kappa statistics for the minute-by-minute performance of each of the methods. Results: 46 participants provided 972 days of accelerometer recordings with corresponding self-reported sleep information. The three sleep-boundary detection methods resulted in mean absolute errors in sleep-onset and wake-up times per individual of 36 min, 34 min and 33 min and kappa statistics of 0.87, 0.89 and 0.89, respectively. Conclusion: Our methods provide a data-driven approach to detect sleep-onset and -end times without the need for self-reported sleep-boundary information. The methods are likely to be of particular use for large-scale studies where the collection of self-reported sleep diaries is impractical. Significance: Objective measures of sleep are needed to reliably detect associations with health outcomes. This work lays the foundation for studies of objectively measured sleep duration and its health consequences in large studies.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the criterion validity of an automated sleep detection algorithm applied to data from three research-grade accelerometers worn on each wrist with concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography ({PSG}). A total of 30 healthy volunteers (mean [{SD}] age 31.5 [7.2] years, body mass index 25.5 [3.7] kg/m2 ) wore an Axivity, {GENEActiv} and {ActiGraph} accelerometer on each wrist during a 1-night {PSG} assessment. Sleep estimates (sleep period time window [{SPT}-window], sleep duration, sleep onset and waking time, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset [{WASO}]) were generated using the automated sleep detection algorithm within the open-source {GGIR} package. Agreement of sleep estimates from accelerometer data with {PSG} was determined using pairwise 95\% equivalence tests (±10\% equivalence zone), intraclass correlation coefficients ({ICCs}) with 95\% confidence intervals and limits of agreement ({LoA}). Accelerometer-derived sleep estimates except for {WASO} were within the 10\% equivalence zone of the {PSG}. Reliability between data from the accelerometers worn on either wrist and {PSG} was moderate for {SPT}-window duration ({ICCs} ≥ 0.65), sleep duration ({ICCs} ≥ 0.54), and sleep onset ({ICCs} ≥ 0.61), mostly good for waking time ({ICCs} ≥ 0.80), but poor for sleep efficiency ({ICCs} ≥ 0.08) and {WASO} ({ICCs} ≥ 0.08). The mean bias between all accelerometer-derived sleep estimates worn on either wrist and {PSG} were low; however, wide 95\% {LoA} were observed for all sleep estimates, apart from waking time. The automated sleep detection algorithm applied to data from Axivity, {GENEActiv} and {ActiGraph} accelerometers, worn on either wrist, provides comparable measures to {PSG} for {SPT}-window and sleep duration, sleep onset and waking time, but a poor measure of wake during the sleep period.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Self-report remains the most practical and cost-effective method for epidemiologic sleep studies involving large population-based samples. Several validated questionnaires have been developed to assess sleep, but these tools are lengthy to administer and may be impractical for epidemiologic studies. We examined whether a 3-item sleep questionnaire, similar to those typically used in epidemiologic studies, closely corresponded with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy monitoring.
{METHODS}: Eligible participants were Western Australian women aged 18 to 80 years. Participants completed a sleep questionnaire, wore a wrist actigraph for 7 nights, and completed a brief daily sleep log. Objective actigraphy measurements for 56 participants were summarized by mean and mode and compared with the subjective reports, using weighted kappa and delta.
{RESULTS}: Data collected from the questionnaire showed poor agreement with objectively measured sleep, with kappas ranging from -0.19 to 0.14.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results indicate that sleep questions typically used in epidemiologic studies do not closely correspond with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy. The findings have implications for studies that have used such sleep questions. A means of appropriately measuring sleep as a risk factor in epidemiologic studies remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {Background Physical activity has not been objectively measured in prospective cohorts with sufficiently large numbers to reliably detect associations with multiple health outcomes. Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the {UK} Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. Methods Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100Hz raw triaxial acceleration data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. Results 103,712 datasets were received (44.8\% response), with a median wear-time of 6.9 days ({IQR}:6.5–7.0). 96,600 participants (93.3\%) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7.5\% (2.35mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen’s d = 0.9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45-54yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0.66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0.12 for men, d = 0.09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0.27 for men, d = 0.15 for women) were small. Conclusions It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent in the afternoon and evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the {UK} Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses.},

Impaired sleep–wake cycles were significantly associated with cognitive impairment, disability, depression, increased falls, body mass index and arthritis but not with any other specific disease markers and with decreased survival.Conclusions: commonly used sleep questionnaires do not differentiate well between those with objectively determined disturbance of sleep–wake cycles and those with normal cycles. Abnormal sleep–wake patterns are associated with institutionalisation, cognitive impairment, disability, depression and arthritis but not with other diseases; there is also an association with reduced survival.},

	abstract = {Background Sleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. Methods We developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the {UK}, and the {USA}). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification \{wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep ({REM}), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep ({NREM})\} and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the {UK} Biobank with {\textasciitilde}100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. Findings After exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95\% limits of agreement ({LoA}): -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for {REM} duration (95\% {LoA}: -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95\% {LoA}: -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for {NREM} duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the {UK} Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 {UK} Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers ({\textless}6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios ({HRs}): 1.69; 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}): 1.28 to 2.24 ) or high sleep efficiency ({HRs}: 1.42; 95\% {CIs}: 1.14 to 1.77). Interpretation Deep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.},

	abstract = {Researchers are increasingly using 24 h accelerometer wear protocols. No automated method has been published that accurately distinguishes ‘waking’ wear time from other data (‘in-bed’, non-wear, invalid days) in young adults. This study examined the validity of an automated algorithm developed to achieve this for hip-worn Actigraph {GT}3X + 60 s epoch data. We compared the algorithm against a referent method (‘into-bed’ and ‘out-of-bed’ times visually identified by two independent raters) and benchmarked against two published algorithms. All methods used the same non-wear rules. The development sample (n = 11) and validation sample (n = 95) were Australian young adults from the Raine pregnancy cohort (54\% female), all aged approximately 22 years. The agreement with Rater 1 in each minute’s classification (yes/no) of waking wear time was examined as kappa (κ), limited to valid days (⩾10 h waking wear time per day) according to the algorithm and Rater 1. Bland–Altman methods assessed agreement in daily totals of waking wear and in-bed wear time. Excellent agreement (κ {\textgreater} 0.75) was obtained between the raters for 80\% of participants (median κ = 0.94). The algorithm showed excellent agreement with Rater 1 (κ {\textgreater} 0.75) for 89\% of participants and poor agreement (κ {\textless} 0.40) for 1\%. In this sample, the algorithm (median κ = 0.86) performed better than algorithms validated in children (median κ = 0.77) and adolescents (median κ = 0.66). The mean difference (95\% limits of agreement) between Rater 1 and the algorithm was 7 (−220, 234) min d−1 for waking wear time on valid days and −41 (−309, 228) min d−1 for in-bed wear time. In this population, the automated algorithm’s validity for identifying waking wear time was mostly good, not worse than inter-rater agreement, and better than the evaluated published alternatives. However, the algorithm requires improvement to better identify in-bed wear time.},

We included all studies that employed Rechtschaffen and Kales rules or American Academy of Sleep Medicine standards. We sought the overall degree of agreement and those for each stage.
{METHODS}: The keywords were "Polysomnography ({PSG})," "sleep staging," "Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K)," "American Academy of Sleep Medicine ({AASM})," "interrater (interscorer) reliability," and "Cohen's kappa." We searched {PubMed}, {OVID} Medline, {EMBASE}, the Cochrane library, {KoreaMed}, {KISS}, and the {MedRIC}. The exclusion criteria included automatic scoring and pediatric patients. We collected data on scorer histories, scoring rules, numbers of epochs scored, and the underlying diseases of the patients.
{RESULTS}: A total of 101 publications were retrieved; 11 satisfied the selection criteria. The Cohen's kappa for manual, overall sleep scoring was 0.76, indicating substantial agreement (95\% confidence interval, 0.71-0.81; P {\textless} .001). By sleep stage, the figures were 0.70, 0.24, 0.57, 0.57, and 0.69 for the W, N1, N2, N3, and R stages, respectively. The interrater reliabilities for stage N2 and N3 sleep were moderate, and that for stage N1 sleep was only fair.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We conducted a meta-analysis to generalize the variation in manual scoring of polysomnography and provide reference data for automatic sleep stage scoring systems. The reliability of manual scorers of polysomnography sleep stages was substantial. However, for certain stages, the results were poor; validity requires improvement.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The Bland-Altman limits of agreement method is widely used to assess how well the measurements produced by two raters, devices or systems agree with each other. However, mixed effects versions of the method which take into account multiple sources of variability are less well described in the literature. We address the practical challenges of applying mixed effects limits of agreement to the comparison of several devices to measure respiratory rate in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}).
{METHODS}: Respiratory rate was measured in 21 people with a range of severity of {COPD}. Participants were asked to perform eleven different activities representative of daily life during a laboratory-based standardised protocol of 57 minutes. A mixed effects limits of agreement method was used to assess the agreement of five commercially available monitors (Camera, Photoplethysmography ({PPG}), Impedance, Accelerometer, and Chest-band) with the current gold standard device for measuring respiratory rate.
{RESULTS}: Results produced using mixed effects limits of agreement were compared to results from a fixed effects method based on analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) and were found to be similar. The Accelerometer and Chest-band devices produced the narrowest limits of agreement (-8.63 to 4.27 and -9.99 to 6.80 respectively) with mean bias -2.18 and -1.60 breaths per minute. These devices also had the lowest within-participant and overall standard deviations (3.23 and 3.29 for Accelerometer and 4.17 and 4.28 for Chest-band respectively).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The mixed effects limits of agreement analysis enabled us to answer the question of which devices showed the strongest agreement with the gold standard device with respect to measuring respiratory rates. In particular, the estimated within-participant and overall standard deviations of the differences, which are easily obtainable from the mixed effects model results, gave a clear indication that the Accelerometer and Chest-band devices performed best.},

The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ({PRISMA}) guidelines. Mean and variability data for sleep duration, number of night wakings, sleep latency, longest sleep period overnight, and number of daytime naps were extracted from questionnaire or diary data from 34 eligible studies. Meta-analysis was conducted within age-bands and categories. In addition, fractional polynomial regression models were used to estimate best-fit equations for the sleep variables in relation to age. Reference values (means) and ranges (±1.96 {SD}) for sleep duration (hours) were: infant, 12.8 (9.7–15.9); toddler/preschool, 11.9 (9.9–13.8); and child, 9.2 (7.6–10.8).

Meta-regression showed predominantly Asian countries had significantly shorter sleep (1h less over the 0–12 year range) compared to studies from Caucasian/non-Asian countries. Night waking data provided 4 age-bands up to 2 years ranging from 0 to 3.4 wakes per night for infants (0–2 months), to 0–2.5 per night (1–2 year-olds). Sleep latency data were sparse but estimated to be stable across 0–6 years.

	abstract = {Wearable physical activity sensors are widely used in research and practice as they provide objective measures of human behavior at a low cost. An important challenge for accurate assessment of physical activity behavior in free-living is the detection non-wear. Traditionally, heuristic algorithms that rely on specific interval lengths have been employed to detect non-wear time; however, machine learned models are emerging. We explore the potential of detecting non-wear using decision trees that combine raw acceleration and skin temperature, and we investigate the generalizability of our models, traditional heuristic algorithms, and recently developed machine learned models by external validation. The Decision tree models were trained using one week of data from thigh- and hip-worn accelerometers from 64 children. External validation was performed using data from wrist-worn accelerometers of 42 adolescents. For non-wear episodes longer than 60 min, the heuristic algorithms performed the best with F1-scores above 0.96. However, regarding episodes shorter than 60 min, the best performing method was the decision tree model including the six most important predictors with F1 scores above 0.74 for all sensor locations. We conclude that for classifying non-wear time, researchers should carefully select an appropriate method and we encourage the use of external validation when reporting on machine learned non-wear models.},

	abstract = {Background Actigraphy may provide a more valid assessment of sleep, circadian rhythm ({CR}), and physical activity ({PA}) than self-reported questionnaires, but has not been used widely to study the association with depression/anxiety and their clinical characteristics. Methods Fourteen-day actigraphy data of 359 participants with current (n = 93), remitted (n = 176), or no (n = 90) composite international diagnostic interview depression/anxiety diagnoses were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Objective estimates included sleep duration ({SD}), sleep efficiency, relative amplitude ({RA}) between day-time and night-time activity, mid sleep on free days ({MSF}), gross motor activity ({GMA}), and moderate-to-vigorous {PA} ({MVPA}). Self-reported measures included insomnia rating scale, {SD}, {MSF}, metabolic equivalent total, and {MVPA}. Results Compared to controls, individuals with current depression/anxiety had a significantly different objective, but not self-reported, {PA} and {CR}: lower {GMA} (23.83 vs. 27.4 milli-gravity/day, p = .022), lower {MVPA} (35.32 vs. 47.64 min/day, p = .023), lower {RA} (0.82 vs. 0.83, p = .033). In contrast, self-reported, but not objective, sleep differed between people with current depression/anxiety compared to those without current disorders; people with current depression/anxiety reported both shorter and longer {SD} and more insomnia. More depressive/anxiety symptoms and number of depressive/anxiety diagnoses were associated with larger disturbances of the actigraphy measures. Conclusion Actigraphy provides ecologically valid information on sleep, {CR}, and {PA} that enhances data from self-reported questionnaires. As those with more severe or comorbid forms showed the lowest {PA} and most {CR} disruptions, the potential for adjunctive behavioral and chronotherapy interventions should be explored, as well as the potential of actigraphy to monitor treatment response to such interventions.},

This review aims at summarising the results of studies published over the last decade regarding the use of actigraphy. Thirty-five studies proved eligible, and results were analysed separately for insomnia, narcolepsy and {RBD}. Actigraphy showed to consistently differentiate insomnia patients from healthy controls. Furthermore, the application of advanced analytical techniques has been shown to provide both unique insights into the physiology of insomnia and sleep misperception and to improve the specificity of actigraphy in detecting wakefulness within sleep periods. Regarding narcolepsy, several studies showed that actigraphy can detect peculiar sleep/wake disruption and the effects of pharmacological treatments. Finally, although the number of studies in {RBD} patients is still limited, the available evidence indicates a reduced amplitude of the activity pattern, sleep-wake rhythm dysregulation and daytime sleepiness. Therefore, the potential use of these markers as predictors of phenoconversion should be further explored. In conclusion, quantitative actigraphy presents a renewed interest when considering the possibility of using actigraphy in clinical sleep medicine to diagnose, monitor, and follow sleep disorders other than {CRSWD}.},

	abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from    imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of    ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or    ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    {ROC} space) than only under-sampling the majority class.  This paper    also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the    minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance (in {ROC} space) than varying the loss    ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of    over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples.  Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a    Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under    the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve ({AUC}) and the {ROC} convex    hull strategy.},

	abstract = {Common medical conditions are often associated with sleep abnormalities. Patients with medical disorders often suffer from poor sleep quality compared to healthy individuals, which in turn may worsen the symptoms of the disorder. Accurate detection of sleep/wake patterns is important in developing personalized digital markers, which can be used for objective measurements and efficient disease management. Big Data technologies and advanced analytics methods hold the promise to revolutionize clinical research processes, enabling the effective blending of digital data into clinical trials. Actigraphy, a non-invasive activity monitoring method is heavily used to detect and evaluate activities and movement disorders, and assess sleep/wake behavior. In order to study the connection between sleep/wake patterns and a cluster headache disorder, activity data was collected using a wearable device in the course of a clinical trial. This study presents two novel modeling schemes that utilize Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) to identify sleep/wake states. The proposed methods are a sequential {CNN}, reminiscent of the bi-directional {CNN} for slot filling, and a Multi-Task Learning ({MTL}) based model. Furthermore, we expand standard "Sleep" and "Wake" activity states space by adding the "Falling asleep" and "Siesta" states. We show that the proposed methods provide promising results in accurate detection of the expanded sleep/wake states. Finally, we explore the relations between the detected sleep/wake patterns and onset of cluster headache attacks, and present preliminary observations.},

	abstract = {This review re-examines the use of accelerometer and oxygen uptake data for the assessment of activity intensity. Accelerometers capture mechanical work, while oxygen uptake captures the energy cost of this work. Frequency filtering needs to be considered when processing acceleration data. A too restrictive filter attenuates the acceleration signal for walking and, to a higher degree, for running. This measurement error affects shorter (children) more than taller (adults) individuals due to their higher movement frequency. Less restrictive filtering includes more movement-related signals and provides measures that better capture mechanical work, but may include more noise. An optimal filter cut-point is determined where most relevant acceleration signals are included. Further, accelerometer placement affects what part of mechanical work being captured. While the waist placement captures total mechanical work and therefore contributes to measures of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature, the thigh and wrist placements capture more internal work and do not provide equivalent measures. Value calibration of accelerometer measures is usually performed using measured oxygen uptake with the metabolic equivalent of task ({MET}) as reference measure of activity intensity. However, the use of {MET} is not stringent and is not a measure of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature. A candidate measure is the mass-specific net oxygen uptake, {VO}2 net ({VO}2 tot - {VO}2 stand). To improve measurement of physical activity intensity using accelerometers, research developments are suggested concerning the processing of accelerometer data, use of energy expenditure as reference for activity intensity, and calibration procedure with absolute versus relative intensity.},

Laboratory-based polysomnography ({PSG}) is deemed the gold standard to measure sleep objectively, but is impractical for long-term and home utilization (e.g. resource-demanding, difficult to use). Hence, alternative devices have been developed. This study aimed to review the literature systematically, providing an overview of available objective sleep measures in non-laboratory settings as an alternative to {PSG}. To identify relevant articles, a specific search strategy was run in {EMBASE}, {PubMed}, {CINAHL}, {PsycInfo} and Compendex (Engineering Village 2). In addition, reference lists of retrieved articles were screened and experts within this research field were contacted. Two researchers, using specified in/exclusion criteria, screened identified citations independently in three stages: on title, abstract and full text. Data from included articles were extracted and inserted into summarizing tables outlining the results. Of the 2217 electronically identified citations, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. Additional searches revealed eight papers. Psychometric characteristics of nine different objective measures of sleep pattern alternatives to {PSG} [(bed) actigraphy, observation, bed sensors, eyelid movement- and non-invasive arm sensors, a sleep switch and a remote device] were evaluated. Actigraphy is used widely and has been validated in several populations. Alternative devices to measure sleep patterns are becoming available, but most remain at prototype stage and are validated insufficiently. Future research should concentrate on the development and further validation of non-invasive, inexpensive and user-friendly sleep measures for non-laboratory settings.},

Despite significant knowledge concerning the importance of arousals for the sleep process in normal subjects and patients, comprehensive age norms have not been published. Methods: Seventy-six normal subjects (40 men) without sleep apnea or periodic limb movements of sleep, aged 18 to 70 years, slept in the sleep laboratory for 1 or more nights. Sleep and arousal data were scored by the same scorer for the first night (comparable to clinical polysomnograms) and summarized by age decade. Results: There were no statistically significant differences for sex or interaction of sex by age (p {\textgreater} .5 for both). The mean arousal index increased as a function of age. Newman-Keuls comparisons (.05) showed arousal index in the 18- to 20-year and 21- to 30-year age groups to be significantly less than the arousal index in the other 4 age groups. Arousal index in the 31-to 40-year and 41-to 50-year groups was significantly less than the arousal index in the older groups. The arousal index was significantly negatively correlated with total sleep time and all sleep stages (positive correlation with stage 1 and wake). Conclusions: Brief arousals are an integral component of the sleep process. They increase with other electroencephalographic markers as a function of age. They are highly correlated with traditional sleep-stage amounts and are related to major demographic variables. Age-related norms may make identification of pathologic arousal easier.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Existing normal polysomnography values are not truly normative as they are based on small sample sizes due to the fact that polysomnography is expensive and burdensome to obtain. There is a clear need for a large sample of truly normative data for clinical management and research. This study is a comprehensive meta-analysis of adult polysomnography parameters scored using recent criteria and establishes normative values adjusted for age and sex.
{METHODS}: For this meta-analysis of adult polysomnography parameters, we searched Scopus for studies of any design published between Jan 1, 2007, and July 31, 2016, that reported polysomnographic parameters scored using recent American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria (2007 or 2012) collected during an overnight level 1 in-laboratory sleep study in healthy controls. We excluded studies of patients with conditions or subjected to treatments that might affect sleep and studies not available in English. Study endpoints were the pooled estimates of 14 reported polysomnographic parameters. Estimates for each parameter were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. The influence of age and sex was ascertained using multivariate mixed-effects meta-regressions. This study is registered with {PROSPERO}, number {CRD}42017074319.
{FINDINGS}: Of 3712 articles, 169 studies, comprising 5273 participants, were eligible for inclusion. We report normative data stratified by age and sex. For each decade of age, total sleep time decreased by 10·1 min (95\% {CI} 7·5 to 12·8), sleep efficiency decreased by 2·1\% (1·5 to 2·6), wake after sleep onset increased by 9·7 min (6·9 to 12·4), sleep onset latency increased by 1·1 min (0·3 to 1·9), arousal index increased by 2·1 events per h (1·5 to 2·6), percentage of N1 sleep increased by 0·5\% (0·1 to 0·8), apnea-hypopnea index increased by 1·2 events per h (0·9 to 1·4), mean oxygen saturation decreased by 0·6\% (0·5 to 0·7), minimum oxygen saturation decreased by 1·8\% (1·3 to 2·3), and periodic limb movement index increased by 1·2 events per h (0·8 to 1·6). Changes with age in the percentage of N2 sleep (0·0\%, 95\% {CI} -0·1 to 0·1), N3 sleep (-0·1\%, -0·1 to 0·0), and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep (0·0\%, -0·1 to 0·0) were not significant. Every 10\% increase in the percentage of male participants was associated with reduced {REM} latency (0·9 min decrease, 95\% {CI} 0·1 to 1·6) and mean oxygen saturation (0·1\% decrease, 0·0 to 0·1), and greater arousal index (0·3 events per h, 0·0 to 0·5) and apnea-hypopnea index (0·2 events per h, 0·1 to 0·3).
{INTERPRETATION}: These normative values serve as a useful control reference for clinicians and for future research where it might be difficult to obtain polysomnographic controls. The resulting normative trends by age and sex might also be hypothesis-generating for a broad range of investigations.

{BACKGROUND}: Actigraphy is commonly used to assist sleep specialists in the diagnosis of various sleep and circadian-rhythm disorders. However, few validation studies incorporate large sample sizes, typical sleep clinic patients, or comparisons with subjective reports of sleep parameters.
{METHODS}: Clinical series with 100 consecutive sleep-disordered patients (69 men, 31 women, mean age of 49+/-14.7 years) at a tertiary sleep disorders center. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures were obtained from epoch-by-epoch comparison of {PSG} and actigraphic data. Subjective sleep parameter data were derived from questionnaires given to subjects in the morning following their recording night.
{RESULTS}: We found that total sleep time and sleep efficiency did not significantly differ between {PSG} data and the combined data obtained from actigraphy and subjective reports. Using a high-threshold (low-wake-sensitivity) actigraphic algorithm, the number of awakenings was not significantly different from those detected by {PSG}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We recommend the use of subjective data as an adjunct to actigraphic data in estimating total sleep time and sleep efficiency in sleep-disordered patients, especially those with disorders of excessive somnolence.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the concordance between wrist- and waist-worn Actigraphs for sleep scoring using existing algorithms developed for placement on the wrist. Sixty-two Danish children aged 10.3 ± 0.6 years (mean ± standard deviation) wore an accelerometer (Actigraph {GT}3X+ Tri-Axis Accelerometer Monitor) on the right hip and on the non-dominant wrist for a continuous 7 days and 8 nights.

The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 98.8–99.7, 29.8–46.9 and 86.6–88.9\%, respectively. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were higher when assessed from the waist compared to the wrist measurement site (73.8 min, P {\textless} 0.001; 12.6\%, P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, the waist-worn and wrist-worn Actigraph monitors cannot be used interchangeably for the measurement of sleep indicators in children using the present algorithms.

	abstract = {Background
We previously published the performance evaluation of an automated electroencephalography ({EEG})-based single-channel sleep–wake detection algorithm called Z-{ALG} used by the Zmachine® sleep monitoring system. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of a new algorithm called Z-{PLUS}, which further differentiates sleep as detected by Z-{ALG} into Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, and Rapid Eye Movement ({REM}) Sleep, against laboratory polysomnography ({PSG}) using a consensus of expert visual scorers.

Methods
Single night, in-lab {PSG} recordings from 99 subjects (52F/47M, 18–60 years, median age 32.7 years), including both normal sleepers and those reporting a variety of sleep complaints consistent with chronic insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome, as well as those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant medications, previously evaluated using Z-{ALG} were re-examined using Z-{PLUS}. {EEG} data collected from electrodes placed at the differential-mastoids (A1–A2) were processed by Z-{ALG} to determine wake and sleep, then those epochs detected as sleep were further processed by Z-{PLUS} to differentiate into Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, and {REM}. {EEG} data were visually scored by multiple certified polysomnographic technologists according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales criterion, and then combined using a majority-voting rule to create a {PSG} Consensus score file for each of the 99 subjects. Z-{PLUS} output was compared to the {PSG} Consensus score files for both epoch-by-epoch (eg, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa) and sleep stage-related statistics (eg, Latency to Deep Sleep, Latency to {REM}, Total Deep Sleep, and Total {REM}).

Results
Sensitivities of Z-{PLUS} compared to the {PSG} Consensus were 0.84 for Light Sleep, 0.74 for Deep Sleep, and 0.72 for {REM}. Similarly, positive predictive values were 0.85 for Light Sleep, 0.78 for Deep Sleep, and 0.73 for {REM}. Overall, kappa agreement of 0.72 is indicative of substantial agreement.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates that Z-{PLUS} can automatically assess sleep stage using a single A1–A2 {EEG} channel when compared to the sleep stage scoring by a consensus of polysomnographic technologists. Our findings suggest that Z-{PLUS} may be used in conjunction with Z-{ALG} for single-channel {EEG}-based sleep staging.},

	abstract = {Background
A need exists, from both a clinical and a research standpoint, for objective sleep measurement systems that are both easy to use and can accurately assess sleep and wake. This study evaluates the output of an automated sleep–wake detection algorithm (Z-{ALG}) used in the Zmachine (a portable, single-channel, electroencephalographic [{EEG}] acquisition and analysis system) against laboratory polysomnography ({PSG}) using a consensus of expert visual scorers.

Methods
Overnight laboratory {PSG} studies from 99 subjects (52 females/47 males, 18–60 years, median age 32.7 years), including both normal sleepers and those with a variety of sleep disorders, were assessed. {PSG} data obtained from the differential mastoids (A1–A2) were assessed by Z-{ALG}, which determines sleep versus wake every 30 seconds using low-frequency, intermediate-frequency, and high-frequency and time domain {EEG} features. {PSG} data were independently scored by two to four certified {PSG} technologists, using standard Rechtschaffen and Kales guidelines, and these score files were combined on an epoch-by-epoch basis, using a majority voting rule, to generate a single score file per subject to compare against the Z-{ALG} output. Both epoch-by-epoch and standard sleep indices (eg, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, latency to persistent sleep, and wake after sleep onset) were compared between the Z-{ALG} output and the technologist consensus score files.

Results
Overall, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting sleep using the Z-{ALG} as compared to the technologist consensus are 95.5\% and 92.5\%, respectively, across all subjects, and the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value for detecting sleep are 98.0\% and 84.2\%, respectively. Overall κ agreement is 0.85 (approaching the level of agreement observed among sleep technologists). These results persist when the sleep disorder subgroups are analyzed separately.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the Z-{ALG} automated sleep–wake detection algorithm, using the single A1–A2 {EEG} channel, has a level of accuracy that is similar to {PSG} technologists in the scoring of sleep and wake, thereby making it suitable for a variety of in-home monitoring applications, such as in conjunction with the Zmachine system.},

The advantages of actigraphy include high accuracy, simplicity of use and low intrusiveness. These features allow the use of actigraphy for determining sleep-wake states in such highly sensitive groups as infants. This study utilizes a motion sensor (accelerometer) for a dual purpose: to determine an infant's position in the crib and to identify sleep-wake states. The accelerometer was positioned over the sacral region on the infant's diaper, unlike commonly used attachment to an ankle. Opposed to broadly used discriminant analysis, this study utilized logistic regression and neural networks as predictors. The accuracy of predicted sleep-wake states was established in comparison to the sleep-wake states recorded by technicians in a polysomnograph study. Both statistical and neural predictors of this study provide an accuracy of approximately 77-92\% which is comparable to similar studies achieving prediction rates of 85-95\%, thus validating the suggested methodology. The results support the use of body motion as a simple and reliable method for determining sleep-wake states in infants. Nonlinear mapping capabilities of the neural network benefit the accuracy of sleep-wake state identification. Utilization of the accelerometer for the dual purpose allows us to minimize intrusiveness of home infant monitors.},

When the sleep-wake scoring algorithm derived from the nondominant hand was used to score the nondominant data for sleep-wake, overall agreement rates with polysomnography scoring ranged between 91 and 93\% for the calibration and validation samples. Results obtained with the same algorithm for the dominant-wrist data were within the same range. Agreement for sleep scoring was consistently higher than for wake scoring. Statistical manipulation of activity levels before applying the scoring algorithm indicated that this algorithm is quite robust toward moderate changes in activity level.

Models were trained using data from three different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64 good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93\% on a previously unseen test set of 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful using machine learning (\$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{F1-score\} {\textgreater} 93.31{\textbackslash}\%\$\$), and when combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour (\$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{r\}=.60\$\$). These Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only accelerometer data.},

	abstract = {Wrist-worn accelerometers are increasingly being used for the assessment of physical activity in population studies, but little is known about their value for sleep assessment. We developed a novel method of assessing sleep duration using data from 4,094 Whitehall {II} Study (United Kingdom, 2012–2013) participants aged 60–83 who wore the accelerometer for 9 consecutive days, filled in a sleep log and reported sleep duration via questionnaire. Our sleep detection algorithm defined (nocturnal) sleep as a period of sustained inactivity, itself detected as the absence of change in arm angle greater than 5 degrees for 5 minutes or more, during a period recorded as sleep by the participant in their sleep log. The resulting estimate of sleep duration had a moderate (but similar to previous findings) agreement with questionnaire based measures for time in bed, defined as the difference between sleep onset and waking time (kappa = 0.32, 95\%{CI}:0.29,0.34) and total sleep duration (kappa = 0.39, 0.36,0.42). This estimate was lower for time in bed for women, depressed participants, those reporting more insomnia symptoms, and on weekend days. No such group differences were found for total sleep duration. Our algorithm was validated against data from a polysomnography study on 28 persons which found a longer time window and lower angle threshold to have better sensitivity to wakefulness, while the reverse was true for sensitivity to sleep. The novelty of our method is the use of a generic algorithm that will allow comparison between studies rather than a “count” based, device specific method.},

	abstract = {Wearable, multisensor, consumer devices that estimate sleep are now commonplace, but the algorithms used by these devices to score sleep are not open source, and the raw sensor data is rarely accessible for external use. As a result, these devices are limited in their usefulness for clinical and research applications, despite holding much promise. We used a mobile application of our own creation to collect raw acceleration data and heart rate from the Apple Watch worn by participants undergoing polysomnography, as well as during the ambulatory period preceding in lab testing. Using this data, we compared the contributions of multiple features (motion, local standard deviation in heart rate, and “clock proxy”) to performance across several classifiers. Best performance was achieved using neural nets, though the differences across classifiers were generally small. For sleep-wake classification, our method scored 90\% of epochs correctly, with 59.6\% of true wake epochs (specificity) and 93\% of true sleep epochs (sensitivity) scored correctly. Accuracy for differentiating wake, {NREM} sleep, and {REM} sleep was approximately 72\% when all features were used. We generalized our results by testing the models trained on Apple Watch data using data from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ({MESA}), and found that we were able to predict sleep with performance comparable to testing on our own dataset. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to analyze raw acceleration and heart rate data from a ubiquitous wearable device with accepted, disclosed mathematical methods to improve accuracy of sleep and sleep stage prediction.},

	abstract = {Background
We tested whether objectively measured indices of obstructive sleep apnea ({OSA}) and sleep quality are associated with coronary artery calcification ({CAC}) prevalence independent of obesity, a classic confounder.

Methods
A total of 1,465 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis participants [mean age 68 years], who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease, had both coronary {CT} and in-home polysomnography and actigraphy. {OSA} categories were defined by apnea-hypopnea index ({AHI}). Prevalence ratios for {CAC} {\textgreater}0 and {\textgreater}400 (high burden) were calculated.

Results
Participants with severe {OSA} ({AHI} ≥ 30; 14.6\%) were more likely to have prevalent {CAC}, relative to those with no evidence of {OSA}, after adjustment for demographics and smoking status [1.16 (95\% {CI}: 1.06–1.26)], body mass index [1.11 (1.02–1.21)], and traditional cardiovascular risk factors [1.10 (1.01–1.19)]. Other markers of hypoxemia tended to be associated with higher prevalence of {CAC} {\textgreater}0. For {CAC} {\textgreater}400 a higher prevalence was observed with both a higher arousal index and less slow-wave sleep. Overall, associations were somewhat stronger among younger participants, but did not vary by sex or race/ethnicity.

Conclusions
In this population-based multiethnic sample severe {OSA} was associated with subclinical coronary artery disease ({CAC} {\textgreater}0), independent of obesity and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, the associations of the arousal index and slow wave sleep with high {CAC} burden suggest that higher nightly sympathetic nervous system activation is also a risk factor. These findings highlight the potential importance in measuring disturbances in {OSA} as well as in sleep fragmentation as possible risk factors for coronary artery disease.},

However, the largest experiments conducted to date, have had only hundreds of participants. In this work, we processed the data of the recently published Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ({MESA}) Sleep study to have both {PSG} and actigraphy data synchronized. We propose the adoption of this publicly available large dataset, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than any other dataset, to systematically compare existing methods for the detection of sleep-wake stages, thus fostering the creation of new algorithms. We also implemented and compared state-of-the-art methods to score sleep-wake stages, which range from the widely used traditional algorithms to recent machine learning approaches. We identified among the traditional algorithms, two approaches that perform better than the algorithm implemented by the actigraphy device used in the {MESA} Sleep experiments. The performance, in regards to accuracy and F1 score of the machine learning algorithms, was also superior to the device’s native algorithm and comparable to human annotation. Future research in developing new sleep-wake scoring algorithms, in particular, machine learning approaches, will be highly facilitated by the cohort used here. We exemplify this potential by showing that two particular deep-learning architectures, {CNN} and {LSTM}, among the many recently created, can achieve accuracy scores significantly higher than other methods for the same tasks.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose an attention based convolutional neural network long short-term memory ({CNN}-{LSTM}) approach for sleep-wake detection with heterogeneous sensor data, i.e., acceleration and heart rate variability ({HRV}). Since the three-dimensional acceleration data was sampled with a high frequency, we firstly design a {CNN}-{LSTM} structure to effectively learn latent features from the acceleration. Meanwhile, considering the unique format of the {HRV} data, some effective features are extracted based on domain knowledge. Next, we design a unified architecture to efficiently merge the features learned by {CNN}-{LSTM} approach from the acceleration and the extracted features from the {HRV}, which enables us to make full use of all the available information from these two heterogeneous sources. Taking into consideration that these two heterogeneous sources may have distinct contributions for the sleep and wake states, we propose an attention network to dynamically adjust the importance of features from the two sources. Real-world experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach for sleep-wake detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all existing approaches for sleep-wake classification. In the evaluation of leave-one-subject-out ({LOSO}) cross-validation which is more challenging and practical, the proposed method achieves remarkable improvements ranging from 5\% to 46\% over the benchmark approaches.},

Previously developed ambulatory sleep detection methods rely either in whole or in part on self-reported diary data as ground truth, which is a problem, since people often do not fill them out accurately. This paper presents an algorithm that uses multimodal data from smartphones and wearable technologies to detect sleep/wake state and sleep onset/offset using a type of recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory ({LSTM}) cells for synthesizing temporal information. We collected 5580 days of multimodal data from 186 participants and compared the new method for sleep/wake classification and sleep onset/offset detection to, first, nontemporal machine learning methods and, second, a state-of-the-art actigraphy software. The new {LSTM} method achieved a sleep/wake classification accuracy of 96.5\%, and sleep onset/offset detection F1 scores of 0.86 and 0.84, respectively, with mean absolute errors of 5.0 and 5.5 min, res-pectively, when compared with sleep/wake state and sleep onset/offset assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries. The {LSTM} results were statistically superior to those from nontemporal machine learning algorithms and the actigraphy software. We show good generalization of the new algorithm by comparing participant-dependent and participant-independent models, and we show how to make the model nearly realtime with slightly reduced performance.},

Accuracy of sleep stage scoring was validated in 70 subjects assessed by six scorers. The best model performed better than any individual scorer (87\% versus consensus). It also reliably scores sleep down to 5 s instead of 30 s scoring epochs. A T1N marker based on unusual sleep stage overlaps achieved a specificity of 96\% and a sensitivity of 91\%, validated in independent datasets. Addition of {HLA}-{DQB}1*06:02 typing increased specificity to 99\%. Our method can reduce time spent in sleep clinics and automates T1N diagnosis.

	abstract = {The present study proposes a deep learning model, named {DeepSleepNet}, for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw single-channel {EEG}. Most of the existing methods rely on hand-engineered features which require prior knowledge of sleep analysis. Only a few of them encode the temporal information such as transition rules, which is important for identifying the next sleep stages, into the extracted features. In the proposed model, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks to extract time-invariant features, and bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory to learn transition rules among sleep stages automatically from {EEG} epochs. We implement a two-step training algorithm to train our model efficiently. We evaluated our model using different single-channel {EEGs} (F4-{EOG}(Left), Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) from two public sleep datasets, that have different properties (e.g., sampling rate) and scoring standards ({AASM} and R\&K). The results showed that our model achieved similar overall accuracy and macro F1-score ({MASS}: 86.2\%-81.7, Sleep-{EDF}: 82.0\%-76.9) compared to the state-of-the-art methods ({MASS}: 85.9\%-80.5, Sleep-{EDF}: 78.9\%-73.7) on both datasets. This demonstrated that, without changing the model architecture and the training algorithm, our model could automatically learn features for sleep stage scoring from different raw single-channel {EEGs} from different datasets without utilizing any hand-engineered features.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Although these modern devices offer many opportunities, e.g. communication and research online, an in-depth understanding of how these devices affect our health, is lacking. Before a definite randomized controlled trial, the {SCREENS} pilot study was conducted to assess compliance to and feasibility of two interventions, a measurement protocol, and a survey-based recruitment strategy. Also, the potential of the interventions to impact leisure time spent non-sedentary in children six-to-ten years of age was explored. Methods Families (N = 12) were recruited through a population-based survey sent out in October of 2018 to adults (N = 1,675) in the Municipality of Middelfart, Denmark. Families were randomized to one of two two-week interventions; an Evening Restriction intervention (no screen media use after six pm) and a General Restrict intervention (limit entertainment-based screen media to three hours/week/person). Intervention compliance was assessed objectively by measuring household {TV} usage, smartphone and tablet activity via an application, and via screen media diaries. During baseline and follow-up, as part of larger protocol, family members wore two triaxial accelerometers for seven consecutive days. The potential of the interventions to impact non-sedentary time was explored based on means and standard errors ({SEs}). Results Despite almost 85\% and 75\% reductions in leisure screen media use 0\% and 50\% of families were compliant in the Evening Restrict group and General Restrict group, respectively, based on strict a priori criteria. Participant feedback indicated that the General Restrict intervention generally was feasibly. Compliance to the accelerometry wear protocol was high (median non-wear was {\textless}1 hour/week). Moreover, the recruitment strategy was implemented and was feasible. The General restrict intervention might increase children’s non-sedentary time (mean ({SE}): 36.6 (23) min/day, N = 6).

	abstract = {As accelerometers are commonly used for 24-h measurements of daily activity, methods for separating waking from sleeping time are necessary for correct estimations of total daily activity levels accumulated during the waking period. Therefore, an algorithm to determine wake and bed times in 24-h accelerometry data was developed and the agreement of this algorithm with self-report was examined. One hundred seventy-seven participants (aged 40–75 years) of The Maastricht Study who completed a diary and who wore the {activPAL}3™ 24 h/day, on average 6 consecutive days were included. Intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}) was calculated and the Bland–Altman method was used to examine associations between the self-reported and algorithm-calculated waking hours. Mean self-reported waking hours was 15.8 h/day, which was significantly correlated with the algorithm-calculated waking hours (15.8 h/day, {ICC} = 0.79, P = {\textless} 0.001). The Bland–Altman plot indicated good agreement in waking hours as the mean difference was 0.02 h (95\% limits of agreement ({LoA}) = −1.1 to 1.2 h). The median of the absolute difference was 15.6 min (Q1–Q3 = 7.6–33.2 min), and 71\% of absolute differences was less than 30 min. The newly developed automated algorithm to determine wake and bed times was highly associated with self-reported times, and can therefore be used to identify waking time in 24-h accelerometry data in large-scale epidemiological studies.},

However, comparisons of methods for measuring sleep and time in bed using the thigh-worn accelerometer are rare. The authors compared the thigh-worn accelerometer algorithm that estimates time in bed with the output of a sleep diary (time in bed and time asleep). Methods: Participants (N = 5,498), from the 1970 British Cohort Study, wore an {activPAL} device on their thigh continuously for 7 days and completed a sleep diary. Bland–Altman plots and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between the algorithm derived and diary time in bed and asleep. Results: The algorithm estimated acceptable levels of agreement with time in bed when compared with diary time in bed (mean bias of −11.4 min; limits of agreement −264.6 to 241.8). The algorithm-derived time in bed overestimated diary sleep time (mean bias of 55.2 min; limits of agreement −204.5 to 314.8 min). Algorithm and sleep diary are reasonably correlated (ρ = .48, 95\% confidence interval [.45, .52] for women and ρ = .51, 95\% confidence interval [.47, .55] for men) and provide broadly comparable estimates of time in bed but not for sleep time. Conclusions: The algorithm showed acceptable estimates of time in bed compared with diary at the group level. However, about half of the participants were outside of the ±30 min difference of a clinically relevant limit at an individual level.},

	abstract = {The {activPAL} monitor, often worn 24 h d−1, provides accurate classification of sitting/reclining posture. Without validated automated methods, diaries—burdensome to participants and researchers—are commonly used to ensure measures of sedentary behaviour exclude sleep and monitor non-wear. We developed, for use with 24 h wear protocols in adults, an automated approach to classify activity bouts recorded in {activPAL} ‘Events’ files as ‘sleep’/non-wear (or not) and on a valid day (or not). The approach excludes long periods without posture change/movement, adjacent low-active periods, and days with minimal movement and wear based on a simple algorithm. The algorithm was developed in one population ({STAND} study; overweight/obese adults 18–40 years) then evaluated in {AusDiab} 2011/12 participants (n = 741, 44\% men, aged {\textgreater}35 years, mean ± {SD} 58.5 ± 10.4 years) who wore the {activPAL}3™ (7 d, 24 h d−1 protocol). Algorithm agreement with a monitor-corrected diary method (usual practice) was tested in terms of the classification of each second as waking wear (Kappa; κ) and the average daily waking wear time, on valid days. The algorithm showed ‘almost perfect’ agreement (κ {\textgreater} 0.8) for 88\% of participants, with a median kappa of 0.94. Agreement varied significantly (p {\textless} 0.05, two-tailed) by age (worsens with age) but not by gender. On average, estimated wear time was approximately 0.5 h d−1 higher than by the diary method, with 95\% limits of agreement of approximately this amount ±2 h d−1. In free-living data from Australian adults, a simple algorithm developed in a different population showed ‘almost perfect’ agreement with the diary method for most individuals (88\%). For several purposes (e.g. with wear standardisation), adopting a low burden, automated approach would be expected to have little impact on data quality. The accuracy for total waking wear time was less and algorithm thresholds may require adjustments for older populations.},

	abstract = {Background: The authors assessed agreement between participant diaries and two automated algorithms applied to {activPAL} ({PAL} Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, United Kingdom) data for classifying awake wear time in three age groups. Methods: Study 1 involved 20 youth and 23 adults who, by protocol, removed the {activPAL} occasionally to create nonwear periods. Study 2 involved 744 older adults who wore the {activPAL} continuously. Both studies involved multiple assessment days. In-bed, out-of-bed, and nonwear times were recorded in the participant diaries. The {CREA} (in {PAL} processing suite) and {ProcessingPAL} (secondary application) algorithms estimated out-of-bed wear time. Second- and day-level agreement between the algorithms and diary was investigated, as were associations of sedentary variables with self-rated health. Results: The overall accuracy for classifying out-of-bed wear time as compared with the diary was 89.7\% (Study 1) to 95\% (Study 2) for {CREA} and 89.4\% (Study 1) to 93\% (Study 2) for {ProcessingPAL}. Over 90\% of the nonwear time occurring in nonwear periods {\textgreater}165 min was detected by both algorithms, while {\textless}11\% occurring in periods ≤165 min was detected. For the daily variables, the mean absolute errors for each algorithm were generally within 0–15\% of the diary mean. Most Spearman correlations were very large (≥.81). The mean absolute errors and correlations were less favorable for days on which any nonwear time had occurred. The associations between sedentary variables and self-rated health were similar across processing methods. Conclusion: The automated awake wear-time classification algorithms performed similarly to the diary information on days without short (≤2.5–2.75 hr) nonwear periods. Because both diary and algorithm data can have inaccuracies, best practices likely involve integrating diary and algorithm output.},

	abstract = {A triaxial accelerometer worn on the thigh can provide information on the angle of rotation of the thigh. These data may be used to estimate periods of lying versus sitting.
          Purpose 
          To develop and test a classification algorithm to identify sedentary events as either lying or sitting events using a thigh-worn, triaxial accelerometer.
          Methods 
          Seven-day free-living activity from 14 sedentary workers was recorded using the {activPAL}3™ monitor. Participants recorded when they went to bed and when they got up in a diary. All “in-bed” sedentary events were assumed to be lying and all “not-in-bed” sedentary events as sitting. An algorithm computed the angle of rotation of the y-axis, which was used to detect orientation of the thigh. Crossing a rotational threshold in the transverse plane of ±65° was used to classify a sedentary event as lying. The classification accuracy of the algorithm was compared with self-reported classification from the diary.
          Results 
          The algorithm classified 96.7\% of the sedentary time “in bed” (sensitivity) as lying and 92.9\% of the time “not in bed” as not lying (specificity).
          Conclusions 
          Triaxial accelerometer data recorded from a single site on the thigh can be used to classify sedentary events as sitting and lying. The automated method developed in this study will allow objective measurement of diurnal lying time and that while sleeping without relying on self-report. This will help advance the understanding of the impact of different types of sedentary behaviors on various health outcomes.},

An algorithm based on sedentary bouts from the proprietary {ActivePAL} software can detect lying down from a single thigh-worn accelerometer using rotations of the thigh.

Aim: To refine and assess the validity of an algorithm to detect lying down from raw data of thigh-worn accelerometers. Axivity-{AX}3 accelerometers were placed on the thigh and upper back (reference) on adults in a development dataset (n = 50) and a validation dataset (n = 47) for 7 days. Sedentary time from the open Acti4-algorithm was used as input to the algorithm. In addition to the thigh-rotation criterion in the existing algorithm, two criteria based on standard deviation of acceleration and a time duration criterion of sedentary bouts were added. The mean difference (95\% agreement-limits) between the total identified lying time/day, between the refined algorithm and the reference was +2.9 (−135,141) min in the development dataset and +6.5 (−145,159) min in the validation dataset. The refined algorithm can be used to estimate lying time in studies using different accelerometer brands.},

{METHODS}: Thirty-four adults (≥18 yr) wore the {activPAL}3, {GENEActiv}, and {ActiGraph} {GT}3X+ on the right thigh and an {ActiGraph} on the right hip while performing four lying, seven sitting, and five upright activities in the laboratory. Lying and sitting tasks incorporated a range of leg angles (e.g., lying with legs bent and sitting with legs crossed). Each activity was performed for 5 min while being directly observed. The percentage of the time the posture was correctly classified was calculated.
{RESULTS}: Participants consisted of 14 males and 20 females (mean age, 27.2 ± 5.9 yr; mean body mass index, 23.8 ± 3.7 kg·m). All postural allocation algorithms applied to monitors worn on the thigh correctly classified ≥93\% of the time lying, ≥91\% of the time sitting, and ≥93\% of the time upright. The {ActiGraph} waist proprietary algorithm correctly classified 72\% of the time lying, 58\% of the time sitting, and 74\% of the time upright. Both the {activPAL} and {ActiGraph} thigh proprietary algorithms misclassified sitting on a chair with legs stretched out (58\% and 5\% classified incorrectly, respectively). The {ActiGraph} thigh proprietary and open-source algorithm applied to the thigh-worn {ActiGraph} misclassified participants lying on their back with their legs bent 27\% and 9\% of the time, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: All postural allocation algorithms when applied to devices worn on the thigh were highly accurate in identifying lying, sitting, and upright postures. Given the poor accuracy of the waist algorithm for detecting sitting, caution should be taken if inferring sitting time from a waist-worn device.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The Prospective Physical Activity Sitting and Sleep consortium ({ProPASS}) is an international collaboration platform committed to harmonise thigh-worn accelerometry data. The aim of this paper is to (1) outline observational thigh-worn accelerometry studies and (2) summarise key strategic directions arising from the inaugural {ProPASS} meeting.
{METHODS}: (1) We performed a systematic scoping review for observational studies of thigh-worn triaxial accelerometers in free-living adults (n≥100, 24 hours monitoring protocols). (2)Attendees of the inaugural {ProPASS} meeting were sent a survey focused on areas related to developing {ProPASS}: important terminology (Q1); accelerometry constructs (Q2); advantages and distinct contribution of the consortium (Q3); data pooling and harmonisation (Q4); data access and sharing (Q5 and Q6).
{RESULTS}: (1) Eighty eligible articles were identified (22 primary studies; n{\textasciitilde}17 685). The accelerometers used most often were the {ActivPAL}3 and {ActiGraph} {GT}3X. The most commonly collected health outcomes were cardiometabolic and musculoskeletal. (2) None of the survey questions elicited the predefined 60\% agreement. Survey responses recommended that {ProPASS}: use the term physical behaviour or movement behaviour rather than 'physical activity' for the data we are collecting (Q1); make only minor changes to {ProPASS}'s accelerometry construct (Q2); prioritise developing standardised protocols/tools (Q4); facilitate flexible methods of data sharing and access (Q5 and Q6).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Thigh-worn accelerometry is an emerging method of capturing movement and posture across the 24 hours cycle. In 2020, the literature is limited to 22 primary studies from high-income western countries. This work identified {ProPASS}'s strategic directions-indicating areas where {ProPASS} can most benefit the field of research: use of clear terminology, refinement of the measured construct, standardised protocols/tools and flexible data sharing.},

	abstract = {Galileo Galilei’s quote ‘ measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so ’ has particular relevance to health behaviours, such as physical activity ({PA}), sitting and sleep, whose measurement during free living is notoriously difficult. To date, much of what we know about how these behaviours affect our health is based on self-report by questionnaires which have limited validity, are prone to bias and inquire about selective aspects of these behaviours. Although self-reported evidence has made great contributions to shaping public health and exercise medicine policy and guidelines until now,1 the ongoing advancements of accelerometry-based measurement and evidence synthesis methods are set to change the landscape. The aim of this editorial is to outline new directions in {PA} and sleep-related epidemiology that open new horizons for guideline development and improvement; and to describe a new research collaboration platform: the Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting, and Sleep consortium ({ProPASS}) (figure 1).



Figure 1 

Measurement technology used in epidemiology has made measurable what was not so until recently. Several population-based studies use accelerometers that are worn by participants for 24 hours a day for a whole week, offering unprecedented insights into the health attributes of {PA}, sitting and sleep. One of the most exciting aspects of accelerometers is that they show great promise for capturing nearly complete accounts of movement behaviour, including posture and activity type detection.2

Methods: Seventeen subjects equipped with triaxial accelerometers ({ActiGraph} {GT}3X+) at the thigh and hip carried out a standardized test procedure including walking, running, cycling, walking stairs, sitting, and standing still. A method was developed (Acti4) to discriminate between these physical activity types based on threshold values of standard deviation of acceleration and the derived inclination. Moreover, the ability of the accelerometer placed at the thigh to detect sitting posture was separately validated during free living by comparison with recordings of pressure sensors in the hip pockets. Results: Sensitivity for discriminating between the physical activity types sitting, standing, walking, running, and cycling in the standardized trials were 99\%–100\% and 95\% for walking stairs. Specificity was higher than 99\% for all activities. During free living (140 hours of measurements), sensitivity and specificity for detection of sitting posture were 98\% and 93\%, respectively. Conclusion: The developed method for detecting physical activity types showed a high sensitivity and specificity for sitting, standing, walking, running, walking stairs, and cycling in a standardized setting and for sitting posture during free living.},

In this study, we defined sociodemographic and sleep characteristics associated with misreporting and assessed whether accounting for these factors better explains variation in objective sleep duration among 2,086 participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos who completed more than 5 nights of wrist actigraphy and reported habitual bed/wake times from 2010 to 2013. Using linear regression, we examined self-report as a predictor of actigraphy-assessed sleep duration. Mean amount of time spent asleep was 7.85 (standard deviation, 1.12) hours by self-report and 6.74 (standard deviation, 1.02) hours by actigraphy; correlation between them was 0.43. For each additional hour of self-reported sleep, actigraphy time spent asleep increased by 20 minutes (95\% confidence interval: 19, 22). Correlations between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed time spent asleep were lower with male sex, younger age, sleep efficiency \&lt;85\%, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration ≥1.5 hours. Adding sociodemographic and sleep factors to self-reports increased the proportion of variance explained in actigraphy-assessed sleep slightly (18\%–32\%). In this large validation study including Hispanics/Latinos, we demonstrated a moderate correlation between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed time spent asleep.

	abstract = {Objectives To describe new {WHO} 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour.
Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with {WHO} protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations.
Results The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150–300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold.
Conclusion These 2020 {WHO} guidelines update previous {WHO} recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the {WHO} Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.},

A long short-term memory ({LSTM}) network is proposed as a solution to model long-term cardiac sleep architecture information and validated on a comprehensive data set (292 participants, 584 nights, 541.214 annotated 30 s sleep segments) comprising a wide range of ages and pathological profiles, annotated according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K) annotation standard. It is shown that the model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches which were often limited to non-temporal or short-term recurrent classifiers. The model achieves a Cohen’s k of 0.61 ± 0.15 and accuracy of 77.00 ± 8.90\% across the entire database. Further analysis revealed that the performance for individuals aged 50 years and older may decline. These results demonstrate the merit of deep temporal modelling using a diverse data set and advance the state-of-the-art for {HRV}-based sleep stage classification. Further research is warranted into individuals over the age of 50 as performance tends to worsen in this sub-population.},

The proper use of wearable technology in sleep research requires validated algorithms that can derive sleep outcomes from the sensor data. Since the publication of the first automated scoring algorithm by Webster in 1982, a variety of sleep algorithms have been developed and contributed to sleep research, including many recent ones that leverage machine learning and / or deep learning approaches. However, it remains unclear how these algorithms compare to each other on the same data set and if these modern data science approaches improve the analytical validity of sleep outcomes based on wrist-worn acceleration data. This work provides a systematic evaluation across 8 state-of-the-art sleep algorithms on a common sleep data set with polysomnography ({PSG}) as ground truth. Despite the inclusion of recently published complex algorithms, simple regression-based and heuristic algorithms demonstrated slightly superior performance in sleep-wake classification and sleep outcome estimation. The performance of complex machine learning and deep learning models seem to suffer from poor generalization. This independent and systematic analytical validation of sleep algorithms provides key evidence on the use of wearable digital health technologies for sleep research and care.},

            Wrist worn raw-data accelerometers are used increasingly in large-scale population research. We examined whether sleep parameters can be estimated from these data in the absence of sleep diaries. Our heuristic algorithm uses the variance in estimated z-axis angle and makes basic assumptions about sleep interruptions. Detected sleep period time window ({SPT}-window) was compared against sleep diary in 3752 participants (range = 60–82 years) and polysomnography in sleep clinic patients (N = 28) and in healthy good sleepers (N = 22). The {SPT}-window derived from the algorithm was 10.9 and 2.9 minutes longer compared with sleep diary in men and women, respectively. Mean C-statistic to detect the {SPT}-window compared to polysomnography was 0.86 and 0.83 in clinic-based and healthy sleepers, respectively. We demonstrated the accuracy of our algorithm to detect the {SPT}-window. The value of this algorithm lies in studies such as {UK} Biobank where a sleep diary was not used.},

	abstract = {Accelerometers placed on the thigh provide accurate measures of daily physical activity types, postures and sedentary behaviours, over 24 h and across consecutive days. However, the ability to estimate sleep duration or quality from thigh-worn accelerometers is uncertain and has not been evaluated in comparison with the ‘gold-standard’ measurement of sleep polysomnography. This study aimed to develop an algorithm for sleep estimation using the raw data from a thigh-worn accelerometer and to evaluate it in comparison with polysomnography. The algorithm was developed and optimised on a dataset consisting of 23 single-night polysomnography recordings, collected in a laboratory, from 15 asymptomatic adults. This optimised algorithm was then applied to a separate evaluation dataset, in which, 71 adult males (mean [{SD}] age 57 [11] years, height 181 [6] cm, weight 82 [13] kg) wore ambulatory polysomnography equipment and a thigh-worn accelerometer, simultaneously, whilst sleeping at home. Compared with polysomnography, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.55 when estimating sleep periods. Sleep intervals were underestimated by 21 min (130 min, Limits of Agreement Range [{LoAR}]). Total sleep time was underestimated by 32 min (233 min {LoAR}). Our results evaluate the performance of a new algorithm for estimating sleep and outline the limitations. Based on these results, we conclude that a single device can provide estimates of the sleep interval and total sleep time with sufficient accuracy for the measurement of daily physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep, on a group level in free-living settings.},

	abstract = {This article surveys bootstrap methods for producing good approximate confidence intervals. The goal is to improve by an order of magnitude upon the accuracy of the standard intervals \${\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}theta\} {\textbackslash}pm z{\textasciicircum}\{({\textbackslash}alpha)\} {\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\$, in a way that allows routine application even to very complicated problems. Both theory and examples are used to show how this is done. The first seven sections provide a heuristic overview of four bootstrap confidence interval procedures: \${BC}\_a\$, bootstrap-t , {ABC} and calibration. Sections 8 and 9 describe the theory behind these methods, and their close connection with the likelihood-based confidence interval theory developed by Barndorff-Nielsen, Cox and Reid and others.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of machine learning for the classification of sleep and other human behaviors from accelerometer data, the need for correctly annotated data is higher than ever. We present and evaluate a novel method for the manual annotation of in-bed periods in accelerometer data using the open-source software Audacity®, and we compare the method to the {EEG}-based sleep monitoring device Zmachine® Insight+ and self-reported sleep diaries. For evaluating the manual annotation method, we calculated the inter- and intra-rater agreement and agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries using interclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. Our results showed excellent inter- and intra-rater agreement and excellent agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries. The Bland-Altman limits of agreement were generally around ±30 min for the comparison between the manual annotation and the Zmachine timestamps for the in-bed period. Moreover, the mean bias was minuscule. We conclude that the manual annotation method presented is a viable option for annotating in-bed periods in accelerometer data, which will further qualify datasets without labeling or sleep records.},
