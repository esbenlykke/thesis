\vspace*{\baselineskip}

The journey of my PhD has been a fulfilling expedition, layered with explorations, discoveries, struggles, and growth. This endeavor was fueled by my interest in understanding the objective measurements of physical behavior and sleep. During my Masters, I found myself increasingly engrossed in these domains.

My subsequent role as a research assistant at Aarhus University opened another dimension of learning for me. The works of my peers, employing machine learning and advanced statistics on accelerometer data, intrigued me. It was as if I found the nexus of my research interests, a perfect alignment that seamlessly fused my curiosities and passions.

One of the most significant hurdles was my limited experience with programming and machine learning, which proved to be a steep learning curve. However, through persistence, I slowly developed the necessary skills to analyze and interpret my data effectively. Another major setback was the failed data collection for my third paper. I spent months visiting families, mounting an ambulatory PSG device on children before bedtime, and facing the harsh reality of dealing with poor data quality.

This thesis brings together my explorations and findings across three papers that carry a consistent emphasis on improving and validating methods to leverage accelerometer data for studying human behaviors. The common thread across these papers is the application of innovative methods, particularly machine learning techniques, to enhance the utility, reliability, and accuracy of free-living accelerometer data for monitoring human sleep and physical activity. The work presented here constitutes a substantial contribution to the field of sleep and physical activity research, particularly in the context of large-scale studies.

Two of these papers have already found their place in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and the third is under review. All of these works are included as appendices to this thesis, and their content has been weaved into the fabric of this thesis.

As I look back at my journey through the PhD program, I am grateful for this opportunity to delve deep into a subject that I am passionate about and to contribute to a field that is evolving rapidly. This experience has instilled in me a sense of tenacity and patience, qualities that I have come to value deeply. I learned that even the most frustrating problems have solutions, and the path to those solutions often leads to personal growth and novel insights.

As I stand on the precipice of my future, I am filled with a sense of anticipation and excitement for the possibilities that lie ahead. I am eager to explore new horizons, to encounter new challenges, and to continue growing as a researcher and as an individual. However, wherever I go and whatever I do, I will carry with me the memories, experiences, and lessons from this incredible journey.

These years have shaped me in ways I could never have imagined at the outset, and for that, I am profoundly grateful. As I close this chapter of my life, I do so with a sense of accomplishment and a promise of continued exploration and discovery in my field. After all, every ending is but a new beginning, and I look forward to the adventures that await.

  The importance of sleep and physical activity tracking in health
  research.
\end{itemize}

Physical behaviors throughout a day encompass a range of activities,
including sleep, physical activity (PA), and sedentary behavior.
Numerous studies over the past decade have underscored the health
benefits of optimal sleep, high PA levels, especially
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kraus_physical_2019}{1},\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee_effect_2012}{2}},
minimal sedentary
periods\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wilmot_sedentary_2012}{3}},
and adequate
sleep\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cappuccio_sleep_2010}{4}}.
This robust evidence has informed public
guidelines\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-borodulin_physical_2023}{\textbf{borodulin\_physical\_2023?}}},
such as the American recommendation of 150 minutes of MVPA per
week\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kl_physical_2018}{5}}, and
the Danish guideline suggesting 30 minutes of MVPA daily for
adults\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-el-zine_fysisk_nodate-1}{6}}
and 60 minutes for
children\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-el-zine_fysisk_nodate}{7}}.

The integration of sleep and physical activity tracking in health
research is paramount for a comprehensive understanding of individual
well-being. Over the years, the significance of both sleep and physical
activity in maintaining optimal health has been increasingly
acknowledged\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kraus_physical_2019}{1},\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee_effect_2012}{2},\protect\hyperlink{ref-liguori_evolving_2023}{8}}.
These elements are foundational to our well-being, influencing a
spectrum of health aspects from mental
health\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-biddle_physical_2011}{9}}
to physical
fitness\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-warburton_health_2017}{10}},
and even disease
prevention\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-strath_guide_2013}{11},\protect\hyperlink{ref-arem_leisure_2015}{12}}.

With the advent of wearable technology and advanced tracking systems,
researchers now possess tools that allow for an in-depth exploration of
the intricate relationship between sleep, physical activity, and overall
health\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rollo_whole_2020}{13}}.
Traditional health assessments might have primarily focused on diet,
weight, or blood pressure. However, by incorporating data on sleep and
physical activity, we can achieve a more holistic understanding of
health. For instance, sleep deprivation is associated with a range of
health issues, from weight gain and decreased immune function to an
increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular
disease\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-warburton_health_2017}{10}}.

Building on this, the ability to monitor sleep and physical activity has
revolutionized personalized health interventions. For example, if data
reveals interrupted sleep patterns, interventions can be customized to
address these specific issues. Similarly, if someone isn't achieving
their physical activity targets, strategies can be formulated to boost
their activity levels, potentially enhancing health
outcomes\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenberger_24-hour_2019}{14}}.
Furthermore, tracking these patterns provides researchers with insights
into the mechanisms of various diseases and health conditions. Early
detection of conditions like sleep apnea, characterized by intermittent
breathing pauses during sleep, can lead to timely management, preventing
a cascade of health
complications\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cappuccio_sleep_2010}{4}}.
For patients undergoing treatments, such as those with depression who
often face sleep disturbances, tracking becomes vital. It allows
healthcare providers to assess the effectiveness of interventions,
whether they're antidepressant medications or other therapeutic
strategies\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-paruthi_consensus_2016}{15}}.

In today's medical landscape, there's a pronounced focus on preventive
healthcare. The principle is clear: it's better to prevent diseases than
to treat them after they manifest. Regular tracking of sleep and
physical activity can act as an early warning system, signaling
potential health risks before they develop into severe conditions. For
instance, consistent inactivity can heighten risks related to obesity,
heart disease, and other chronic
ailments\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-tremblay_sedentary_2017}{16}}.
Early detection through tracking can pave the way for timely
interventions and preventive
actions\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-liguori_evolving_2023}{8}}.

\hypertarget{measurement-of-physical-activity-and-sleep}{%
\subsection{Measurement of Physical Activity and
Sleep}\label{measurement-of-physical-activity-and-sleep}}

Physical activity and sleep are integral components of human behavior.
Physical activity is characterized by multiple dimensions such as
frequency, duration, intensity, and domains, making it challenging to
measure all its aspects (21). Similarly, sleep is essential for health,
and its accurate monitoring in terms of duration, quality, architecture,
and circadian patterns is crucial. Various techniques are available to
quantify both PA and sleep, broadly grouped into subjective and
objective methods.

\hypertarget{subjective-methods}{%
\subsubsection{Subjective Methods}\label{subjective-methods}}

Physical Activity Questionnaires and Diaries/Logs

In epidemiological studies, self-report methods, including PA
questionnaires and diaries, have been primary tools due to their low
cost, ease of use, and ability to capture the type and context of
PA(25). Despite their advantages, these methods can be prone to biases,
including reporting bias and misinterpretation, and may not always be
reliable(25).

Sleep Questionnaires and Diaries

Subjective sleep quality can be assessed using tools like the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index, reflecting one's satisfaction with sleep over a
specified period, such as a month(78). While they are practical and
cost-effective, self-report sleep assessments can overestimate sleep
duration and may not capture all nuances of sleep quality(79). Sleep
diaries, often regarded as the ``gold standard'' for subjective sleep
assessment, provide daily insights but are dependent on memory and
participant adherence(82).

\hypertarget{objective-methods}{%
\subsubsection{Objective Methods}\label{objective-methods}}

Direct Observation and Polysomnography (PSG)

Direct observation allows researchers to record an individual's PA and
sleep behaviors, capturing intricate details like frequency, duration,
and intensity(21). PSG, on the other hand, is the gold standard for
sleep measurement, monitoring various physiological aspects in a
controlled setting(78). Both methods, while comprehensive, can be costly
and labor-intensive.

Doubly Labelled Water Method

This method provides an estimate of total energy expenditure over
several days and is a gold standard for PA(25). It's a powerful tool but
comes with high costs and doesn't provide granular details on PA
dimensions(26).

Physiological Recordings

Heart rate (HR) recordings can be used to estimate PA intensity,
assuming a linear relationship between HR and PA intensity(27). While
relatively cost-effective, various external factors can influence HR,
making it less accurate for certain activities(27).

Device-based Methods: Pedometers, Accelerometers, and Actigraphy

Pedometers are simple devices that count steps and can provide
additional metrics like distance traveled and calories burned(21).
Accelerometers, such as GENEActiv and ActiGraph, offer detailed
recordings of raw triaxial linear acceleration data, capturing a wide
range of PA and sleep data(28). Wrist actigraphy, commonly used in sleep
research, measures wrist movements to assess sleep or waking state(85).
These devices are convenient and non-intrusive, but their data might
vary due to different technical characteristics, making direct
comparisons challenging(33).

\hypertarget{sleep-assessment-with-accelerometry}{%
\subsubsection{Sleep Assessment with
Accelerometry}\label{sleep-assessment-with-accelerometry}}

Wrist-worn accelerometers have become increasingly popular for PA
assessment. They have been developed separately from clinical wrist
actigraphy but offer the potential for dual PA and sleep data
collection(90). New algorithms, like the GGIR-package in R, combine
24-hour activity data, but they often require a sleep log for
accuracy(92). Some algorithms can detect sleep periods even without
sleep diaries, but their validation remains limited(93).

\end{itemize}

Some of these limitations can be addressed with 24-hour
accelerometer-based protocols, especially those worn on the
wrist\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenberger_24-hour_2019}{14}}.
Wrist accelerometers are small, non-invasive,
waterproof\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-welk_reliability_2004}{17}},
allowing for continuous, 24-hour wear with minimal disruption to the
wearer, and permit uninterrupted activity measurement throughout the
day, thereby tracking and analyzing daily changes in PA and sleep
behaviors. Furthermore, the latest accelerometers supply raw
acceleration data that can be processed using open-source analytical
techniques to produce estimates of sleep, sedentary behavior, and
PA\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-migueles_comparability_2019}{18}}.
Simultaneous measurement of physical behaviors, particularly feasible
with wrist accelerometry, can offer a better comprehension of the
influence of these behaviors on health indicators and their
interrelationships. This data could be critical in shaping future health
recommendations or interventions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Supervised learning and annotation of data sources
\end{itemize}

Machine learning stands at the crossroads of statistics and computer
science. It embodies the principles of discerning patterns and
relationships from data, a foundational tenet of statistics, while also
leveraging the power of efficient computing algorithms, a core concept
in computer
science\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hastie01statisticallearning}{19}}.
With the surge in data scale, encompassing billions or even trillions of
data points, this synergy becomes essential to navigate the intricate
landscape of data analysis.

One of the primary branches of machine learning is supervised learning.
Its primary objective is to predict known outputs based on inputs.
Real-world applications of supervised learning span across various
domains. For instance, in machine learning competitions, challenges
often include tasks such as handwriting recognition, image
classification (e.g., discerning between a cat and a dog), and document
categorization (e.g., differentiating between a clinical trial on heart
failure and a financial report). These tasks aim to emulate or even
surpass human capabilities in specific areas. Supervised learning
essentially revolves around two core concepts: classification
(categorizing data into predefined groups) and prediction (estimating
unknown parameters).

Delving deeper into its applications, consider the realm of physical
activity and sleep research. Here, supervised learning plays a pivotal
role. For instance, algorithms can automatically classify activity
levels---from sedentary to vigorous---using data from accelerometers.
Similarly, in sleep studies, such algorithms can discern between various
sleep stages like light sleep or REM, using accelerometer or actigraphy
data. While these machines emulate human analysts, their capabilities
can extend beyond, unveiling insights or patterns not immediately
visible to human researchers. A predictive model, for example, might
forecast the risk of metabolic syndrome based on sedentary time patterns
or predict sleep disorders from sleep pattern variations. (REFS P√Ö HELE
AFSNITTET)

The utilization of machine learning to decipher sleep and physical
activity from accelerometry data is gaining traction. Its capability to
model intricate non-linear relationships is unparalleled compared to
traditional statistical methods like linear
regression\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-fiorillo_automated_2019}{20}}.
Yet, the success of supervised learning hinges on abundant and
accurately annotated data for ensuring both precision and
applicability\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-van_der_ploeg_modern_2014}{21}}.

The significance of sleep, especially for children's health and
development, is
well-established\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-chaput_systematic_2017}{22}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-st-onge_sleep_2016}{24}}.
Healthy sleep encompasses several factors like duration, timing, and
quality\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-gruber_position_2014}{25}}.
Yet, the potential of advanced machine learning in evaluating sleep
using accelerometer data is still largely
untapped\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-haghayegh_application_2020}{26}}.

Despite the supremacy of Polysomnography (PSG) as the gold standard for
objective sleep analysis, its high costs, and intrusive nature
underscore the value of accelerometry---a less invasive and more
cost-effective
alternative\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-vaughn_technical_2008}{27}}.
Recent endeavors in this domain include PSG-assessed sleep-wake
classification using wrist-worn accelerometers. For example,
Sundararajan et
al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sundararajan_sleep_2021}{28}}
leveraged a random forest machine learning algorithm, achieving
commendable results. Yet, issues like high false discovery rates point
to challenges such as limited subject variation.

To address these challenges, there's a clear imperative to diversify the
sample base and extend recording durations. While accelerometry has its
limitations, its feasibility for prolonged, out-of-lab recordings makes
it
invaluable\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-van_de_water_objective_2011}{29}}.
Given these dynamics, the focus should lean towards sleep timing
algorithms rather than sleep staging.

A crucial aspect of deciphering sleep/wake cycles from accelerometry
data is the annotation of time in bed, which, although not indicative of
actual sleep duration, provides crucial insights. Such annotations can
stem from individual sleep diaries, EEG-based
recordings\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-younes_staging_2016}{30}},
or systems capturing tracheal
sounds\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-dafna_sleep-wake_2015}{31},\protect\hyperlink{ref-montazeri_ghahjaverestan_sleepwakefulness_2020}{32}}.
Given its practicality, accelerometry continues to be a staple in sleep
research, echoing its immense potential and
adaptability\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hees_novel_2015}{33}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-barouni_ambulatory_2020}{36}}.

\section{Manual Annotation of Time in Bed Using Free-Living Recordings
of Accelerometry
Data}\label{manual-annotation-of-time-in-bed-using-free-living-recordings-of-accelerometry-data}}

This segment of the thesis encompasses the methods, results, and
discussion for Paper I. The study underscores the importance of
effective machine learning algorithms for sleep/wake cycles, which
ideally necessitate correct data annotations over a span of 7-10 days.
Although sleep diaries or EEG recordings can annotate `time in bed',
many researches predominantly rely on accelerometry. This emphasizes the
imperative for enhanced annotation techniques and their validity. Our
objective is to introduce a manual annotation method, gauge its
precision, and determine its consistency. Some of the details presented
here were previously mentioned in the published version of Paper
I\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-skovgaard_manual_2021}{37}}.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{study-population}{%
\subsubsection{Study Population}\label{study-population}}

The data for this study was sourced from the SCREENS pilot trial
(www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03788525), a two-arm parallel-group
cluster-randomized trial with two intervention groups, conducted between
October 2018 and March
2019\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rasmussen_feasibility_2021}{38},\protect\hyperlink{ref-rasmussen_short-term_2020}{39}}.
There was no control group in this trial.

Families from the Middelfart municipality in Denmark were approached for
participation if they had a child aged between 6 to 10 years living with
them, out of a total of 1686 families. To qualify, the parent's screen
media usage had to exceed the median of 2.7 hours per day, based on
survey responses from 394 respondents. Additionally, all children in the
household needed to be older than 3.9 years to ensure that sleep
measurements weren't disrupted by the nocturnal awakenings typical of
infants or toddlers. For a comprehensive list of inclusion and exclusion
criteria, refer to Pedersen et
al.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-pedersen_self-administered_2021}{40}}.

The study ultimately included data from 14 children and 19 adults. These
participants weren't advised to alter their sleep or bedtime routines
for the interventions. While the study focused on nightly sleep time as
recorded by the EEG-based sleep staging system, any napping behavior of
the participants was deemed irrelevant.

All data collection procedures were reported to the local data
protection department, SDU RIO (ID: 10.391), in compliance with the
Danish Data Protection Agency's regulations.

\hypertarget{actigraphy}{%
\subsubsection{Actigraphy}\label{actigraphy}}

Both adults and children participated in 24-hour accelerometry
recordings using two triaxial accelerometers, Axivity AX3 (Axivity Ltd.,
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The Axivity AX3 is a compact device, measuring
23 mm √ó 32.5 mm √ó 7.6 mm and weighing just 11 g. It was set with a
sensitivity of ¬±8 g and a sampling frequency of 50 Hz.

Participants wore the accelerometers at two specific anatomical
locations. The first was positioned on the right hip, secured in a
pocket attached to a belt around the waist, ensuring the USB connector
faced outward from the body's right side. The second accelerometer was
placed midway between the hip and knee on the right thigh, housed in a
pocket on a belt, with the USB connector also facing away from the body.

For both the baseline and follow-up, the devices were worn for a
duration of one week (seven consecutive days). This duration aligns with
the recommended number of days to reliably gauge habitual physical
activity\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-jaeschke_variability_2018}{41}}.

\hypertarget{zmachine-insight-sleep-assessments}{%
\subsubsection{Zmachine¬Æ Insight+ Sleep
Assessments}\label{zmachine-insight-sleep-assessments}}

Both adults and children were assessed for their sleep patterns using
the Zmachine¬Æ (ZM) Insight+ model DT-200 (General Sleep Corporation,
Cleveland, OH, USA), Firmware version 5.1.0. This assessment was
concurrent with the accelerometer recordings. At the baseline, the sleep
assessment spanned 3--4 nights, while during the follow-up, it was
conducted over 3 nights.

The ZM device operates by measuring sleep through a single-channel EEG,
specifically from the differential mastoid (A1--A2) EEG location,
evaluated on a 30-second epoch basis. Designed for use in everyday
settings, the ZM provides an objective measurement of various sleep
parameters, including sleep duration, sleep stage classification, and
latency to different sleep stages.

The ZM's algorithm has been benchmarked against polysomnography (PSG) in
laboratory settings for both adults with and without chronic sleep
issues\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wang_evaluation_2015}{42},\protect\hyperlink{ref-kaplan_performance_2014}{43}}.
Our findings indicate that the ZM is effectively applicable to both
children and adults for multi-day measurements in real-world
settings\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hees_novel_2015}{33}}.
Notably, the device showcased a high accuracy in distinguishing between
sleep and wakefulness, with sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, and negative predictive values being 95.5\%, 92.5\%,
98\%, and 84.2\%,
respectively\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kaplan_performance_2014}{43}}.

For the assessment, three electrodes (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark, type:
N-00-S/25) are positioned on the mastoids (for signal) and the nape (as
ground). About half an hour before their intended sleep time,
participants' skin areas are cleaned with alcohol swabs, after which the
electrodes are affixed. An EEG cable connects these electrodes to the ZM
device. A preliminary sensor check ensures all electrodes are correctly
mounted; any issues are promptly addressed by replacing the problematic
electrodes. Additionally, participants, or parents on behalf of their
children, recorded their sleep and wake times daily in a dedicated
diary.

\hypertarget{audacity}{%
\subsubsection{Audacity}\label{audacity}}

Audacity¬ÆÔ∏è is a distinguished free audio editing
software\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-audacity}{44}}. The
genesis of Audacity can be traced back to the fall of 1999, when it
emerged as an innovative project led by Dominic Mazzoni and Roger
Dannenberg at Carnegie Mellon University. By May 2000, it was unveiled
to the world as an open-source audio editor. Since its inception,
Audacity has undergone significant evolution. The software, developed
collaboratively by the community, now boasts of hundreds of unique
features, offers complete support for professional-grade 24-bit and
32-bit audio, has a comprehensive manual available in multiple
languages, and has witnessed distribution in the millions. Today, a
dedicated team of volunteers from various corners of the globe continues
to maintain and enhance Audacity. It is disseminated under the GNU
General Public License, granting everyone the freedom to utilize the
software for personal, educational, or commercial endeavors.

In the realm of accelerometer data analysis, Audacity stands out. It
furnishes researchers with the capability to meticulously scrutinize
high-resolution raw accelerometer data with unparalleled precision.
Users can quickly zoom in to delve deeper into specific segments of the
recording, like certain patterns around bedtime, or zoom out for a
broader perspective, such as data spanning a week. Furthermore,
Audacity's sophisticated labeling function is pivotal for annotating the
accelerometry data. Any generated labels can be preserved in an
individual file and later integrated into machine learning algorithms.
This level of detailed manual inspection of high-resolution
accelerometer data offered by Audacity is, based on our knowledge,
unparalleled by any other software.

Within the Audacity interface, there's the possibility of amalgamating
over 100 channels of data. This aids in the merging of distinct signal
features derived from acceleration. The integration of multiple signal
features is intriguing as it might enhance the visual comprehension and
classification of inherent behaviors. Nevertheless, an excessive
conglomeration of signal features might obscure the precise
identification of targeted behaviors. For our study, we incorporated a
total of seven distinct signal features. The criteria for classifying
``lying'' in the first feature are explicit: if the inclination of the
hip accelerometer surpasses 65 degrees and the thigh accelerometer
simultaneously identifies as ``sitting'' based on Skotte et al.'s
activity type classification
algorithm\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-skotte_detection_2014}{45}}.
The other signal features, barring ``time'', are directly procured from
Skotte et al.'s algorithm. These features, delineated in Table 1,
concern the longitudinal axis of the body. Data derived from
accelerometry undergoes processing using a window length of two seconds
(60 samples) and has a 50\% overlap (30 samples), ensuring a resolution
of one second. The methodologies from Skotte et al.~and those generating
the first feature rely exclusively on the accelerometer's
inclination(s). Hence, while they can determine time in bed and
participant's posture, they aren't precise indicators for pinpointing
exact in-bed and out-of-bed moments.

To provide a visual perspective, Figure~\ref{fig-screen_full} and
Figure~\ref{fig-screen_night} depict the Audacity interface displaying
all seven signal features as cataloged in
Table~\ref{tbl-man_signal_features}. Figure~\ref{fig-screen_full} offers

\subsubsection{Annotation Process Conducted by Expert
Raters}\label{annotation-process-conducted-by-expert-raters}}

Three experienced researchers, well-versed in working with accelerometer
data, were chosen as raters. Their proficiency ensured that they had the
requisite knowledge to accurately interpret the various data channels
presented to them. Each rater meticulously reviewed and labeled each
wav-file, marking specific timestamps that indicated in-bed and
out-of-bed activities. These annotations were then saved as individual
text files. For ensuring consistency and reliability in the annotations,
each wav-file underwent two rounds of labeling. Importantly, at no point
during this process were the raters privy to any prior annotations,
either made by themselves or their colleagues.

\hypertarget{establishing-the-ground-truth-using-zm}{%
\subsubsection{Establishing the Ground Truth Using
ZM}\label{establishing-the-ground-truth-using-zm}}

The definitive ground truth for in-bed and out-of-bed time frames was
gleaned from the sleep staging data derived from the ZM. This was
established by identifying the first and last events at night that did
not present any sensor-related issues. Nights where the ZM detected
sensor problems, either at the onset or conclusion of the recording,
were excluded from further consideration. Such sensor issues typically
arise due to inadequate attachment of electrodes. To maintain accuracy
in data collection, all participants were meticulously instructed to
affix the ZM and activate it precisely at their bedtime and to detach it
upon waking. These crucial timestamps were then utilized as the ground
truth for the study.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Statistical Analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

The statistical interpretations for this study were achieved using the R
statistical software (version 4.0.2, released on 22 June 2020) and its
complementary interface, RStudio (version 1.1.456). For continuous
variables, the descriptive attributes were gauged using medians and
interquartile ranges. Meanwhile, categorical variables were assessed
based on their proportions. To offer a clear distinction, the
characteristics for children and adults were presented separately.

The core of the statistical analysis encompassed agreement studies which
were executed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the
Bland--Altman analysis. Additionally, to provide a comprehensive visual
representation of the agreement and symmetry across methodologies,
probability density distribution plots were integrated. The ICC, as a
metric, goes beyond merely correlating two techniques; it evaluates if
they align in magnitude. The scale for interpretation is as follows:

\(ICC < 0.5\) signifies poor agreement

\(0.5 < ICC > 0.75\) indicates moderate agreement

\(0.75 < ICC > 0.9\) represents good agreement

\(ICC > 0.90\) underscores excellent agreemen

In this research, the ICC values were interpreted based on their 95\%
confidence intervals, adhering to recommended
guidelines\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-koo_guideline_2016}{46}}.
The Bland--Altman analysis, on the other hand, is a tool to measure the
concurrence between two measuring
techniques\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bland_measuring_1999}{47}}.
It calculates the average of the differences (representing bias) between
the two methods, and also establishes the limits of this agreement. A
positive mean difference suggests an earlier underestimation of the
in-bed or out-of-bed timestamp relative to the ZM, while a negative
difference indicates a later overestimation.

Analyses}\label{intraclass-correlation-coefficient-analyses}}

The analyses of Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) underscored an exemplary
consistency when comparing ZM's automatic in-bed annotations with manual
annotations. This was evident in both metrics assessed: time to bed and
time out of bed. The high agreement was consistent across both
evaluation phases---Round 1 and Round 2---and was observed in the
initial baseline as well as the subsequent follow-up assessments.
Reinforcing the robustness of these findings, the lower bounds of the
confidence intervals consistently remained above 0.9, suggesting a high

In our analysis, we also identified a remarkable consistency between the
data from self-reports and the ZM measurements. This high level of
agreement was evident in both the initial baseline data as well as the
subsequent follow-up data. The strength of this agreement is underscored

Our analysis evaluated the agreement among three manual raters in
annotating timestamps for both `to bed' and `out of bed' events. The
Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) from this evaluation
demonstrated strong consensus among the raters. Specifically, the lower
bounds of the 95\% confidence intervals were consistently strong, never
dropping below 0.88, highlighting both good and excellent agreement
levels. However, when analyzing the ICCs more closely, subtle variations
appear between the `to bed' and `out of bed' timestamps. This nuanced
observation is detailed in Table~\ref{tbl-man_icc_man_man}.

The test-retest reliability exhibited good to excellent ICC agreement
for each rater between the first and second rounds, applicable to both
baseline and follow-up data (refer to
Table~\ref{tbl-man_icc_test_retest}). This robust reliability is further
evidenced by the 95\% confidence intervals having lower limits not less
than 0.86. While the ICCs across raters are broadly consistent, there's
a distinction: Raters 1 and 3 had slightly reduced agreement in their
baseline to-bed annotations relative to subsequent ones. In contrast,
Rater 2's ICC scores remained stable and didn't reflect this trend.
