## Why Do We Care About Sleep?

![](img/sleep_health_effects.png)

::: footer
Feingold et al. 2022
:::

::: notes
Sufficient sleep is important in maintaining overall health. <br> Yet insufficient sleep has become a widespread issue, heightening the risk of many serious illnesses. <br> Good sleep not only benefits physical health but also mental well-being and life quality. It's crucial for healthcare providers to educate patients about sleep health and promote lifestyle changes to enhance it. 
:::

## How Is "Good Sleep" Defined?

<br> Good sleep is both the **amount** of sleep and the **quality** of your sleep

::: notes
In simple terms, good sleep is both the amount of sleep you get in a night and the quality of your sleep. <br> Most commonly determined by self-report questionnaires or sleep logs. <br> Gold standard PSG. <br> But we can also evaluate sleep using accelerometers. Wrist-accelerometry being the most common wear-location.

Polysomnography (PSG):

Gold-standard technique in sleep research.<br> Combines EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, respiratory and pulse oximetry measurements.<br> Captures comprehensive sleep data in a clinical setting.<br> Useful for diagnosing sleep disorders but costly, requires specialized personnel, and may not reflect free-living sleep conditions. <br> In summary, PSG is not feasible in large-scale studies <br> Note: rater bias -\> objectivity?

Emergence of single-channel EEG-based sleep staging algorithms.

Zmachine® Insight+ (ZM): Gaining recognition in sleep studies. Validated against PSG, offering comparable data quality. Cost-effective and requires less specialized oversight. User-friendly for multi-night, real-world evaluations. Ideal for machine learning analyses due to consistent multi-night data. Despite advantages, still has considerable costs and participant demands.

Another low-burden alternative is accelerometry.

Heuristic algorithms to score sleep.

Increasing data availability makes the use of ML more advantages.

::: notes
Accelerometry as an Alternative to EEG:

Used to overcome limitations of EEG systems and self-reported sleep assessments.

Algorithm Development in Actigraphy:

Evolution from activity count-based to raw acceleration data algorithms. Notable algorithms: ESS (Estimation of Stationary Sleep-segments), algorithm based on accelerometer orientation angle. Shift towards machine learning approaches for enhanced data utilization.

ML have shown superior performance.

Lots of data is necessary to effectively develop robust ML models.

The goal is to construct a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven decisions rather than following strictly static instructions (heuristic algorithms)

Learning (training): learn model using training data

Testing: test model using unseen data to assess model performance

Besides accurate labels, the training data must not contain missing data

Essential for accurate human motion and behavior analysis.

Accurate differentiation between non-wear periods and sleep is crucial

heuristic algorithms typically rely on consecutive zero counts

Also, some evidence suggest that incorporating surface skin temperature can enhance accuracy

ML methods include random forests and convolutional neural networks

Ongoing search for an optimal method to classify non-wear time in diverse settings

## Thesis Aims and Objectives {.center-text}

<br>

> The overall aim was to develop methods and models for the analysis and interpretation of sleep in accelerometer data

:::: columns
::: {.column width=33% .center-text .smaller-font}
**Paper 1**

Introduce a method for manually annotating in-bed time in raw accelerometry data, validate these annotations against the Zmachine and sleep diaries, and evaluate the consistency of these manual annotations
:::
::: {.column width=33% .center-text .smaller-font}
**Paper 2**

Assess decision tree models for detecting non-wear time in data from thigh and hip-worn accelerometers, including skin temperature, and compare machine-learned models with heuristic algorithms for hip, thigh, and wrist-worn devices.
:::
::: {.column width=33% .center-text .smaller-font}
**Paper 3**

Assess the performance of different ML models in estimating in-bed and sleep time and evaluate precision of derived sleep quality metrics, benchmarking all included methods against sleep recordings of the ZM.
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
The overall aim wass bla blabla through these three paper/manuscripts

Paper 1: The objectives of paper I is to present a method for manually annotating individual
bedtime and wake-up times using raw accelerometry data. Furthermore, to validate
the accuracy of these annotations by comparing them with in-bed and out-of-bed
timestamps as determined by the ZM and by a prospective sleep diary, and lastly,
to assess both inter-rater and intra-rater agreement of the manual annotations.

I like to think of these three papers as enrichment of data, ensure integrity of data, utilization of the data with the combined aim to detect sleep

## Annotation Software and Features

```

![](img/audacity.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
We derived the following signal features from the raw acceleration signal...

Criteria for "lying" based on hip accelerometer inclination (>65 degrees) and thigh accelerometer's "sitting" status.

Most features, except for "time", derived directly from Skotte et al.’s activity type classification algorithm.

Audacity, a open-source audio-editing tool (sorry for the poor-quality screenshot)

Application in Accelerometer Data Analysis:

Useful for detailed inspection of high-resolution raw accelerometer data.

Enables zooming in on specific segments and broad overview of longer data spans.

Annotation process:

Three raters independently reviewed and labeled each wav-file for in-bed and out-of-bed actvities

Annotations saved as individual text files.

Each file labeled twice by each rater for reliability

Raters unaware of prior annotations to avoid biases and maintain objectivity.

## Contributions of Paper 1

<br>

- Presented a method for manually annotating in-bed periods using accelerometry data
- Manually annotating in-bed periods is comparable to sleep diaries and ZM
- Low inter- and intra-rater bias

::: {.notes}
Introduction of a Manual Annotation Methodology:

Presented a method for manually annotating in-bed periods using accelerometry data.
Evaluated the method's accuracy across multiple raters and compared it with ZM and sleep diary data.

High Accuracy and Reliability:

Demonstrated good-to-excellent inter- and intra-rater agreement.
Excellent agreement between manual annotations and ZM, and between self-reported and ZM sleep times.

Mean Bias and Probability Density Analysis:

Found mean bias between manual annotations, self-reported sleep times, and ZM within ±6 minutes.
Probability density plots showed comparable symmetry and positioning of outliers.

## Discussion

<br> 

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Challenges in differentiating pre-bedtime and actual bedtime

- Potential for broader research applications

- Better precision compared to heuristic algorithms

- Generalizability of raters
:::

::: {.notes}
The difficulty raters faced in distinguishing between inactive behavior before bed and actual bedtime, indicating a potential area for method refinement.

The adaptability of the manual annotation method to various research areas beyond sleep detection, like annotating non-wear time or synchronizing device clocks.

Suggesting that manual annotations, while more labor-intensive, offer superior precision in identifying exact moments compared to automated algorithms

::: {.notes}
Using Actigraphy counts, we identified periods of no movement that registered
zero counts for at least 60 continuous minutes. Actigraphy counts operate with a deadband set at 68 mg, which denotes the minimum detectable acceleration threshold.

Uses raw acceleration and surface skin temperature. At least 120 minutes with less than 20 mg is non-wear. Periods between 45-120 minutes are non-wear if the average temperature is below a personalized threshold within the period. Finally, the algorithm can detect non-wear periods as short as 10 minutes, but only if the period ends within the expected wake time (6 AM to 10 PM).

Random forests: trained on wrist data form 134 subjects aged 20-70 years. Ground truth non-wear time was determined as the the PSG system was not worn. Only if the sd of the acceleration exceeeded 13 mg outside the PSG recording, was the the data treated as wear-time. 

CNN: trained on hip data from 583 subjects aged 40-84. It first identifies potential non-wear episodes using a standard deviation threshold. Then, rather than analyzing acceleration within these intervals, it focuses on the signal shape of raw acceleration immediately before and after these episodes. The method detects non-wear periods by identifying when the accelerometer is removed and reattached.
